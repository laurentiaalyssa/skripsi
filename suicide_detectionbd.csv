The world we live in is hellish, terrifying, evil, and cruel. I live in the United States where we have a psychopathic warmongering fascist as our president. We elected him. The people wanted this to happen. The rest of the world isn't much better and often worse, filled with tyrannical dictators, oppressive regimes, and evil corporations that exploit the vulnerable. There's so much nastiness and cruelty in the world and it's all you ever read in the headlines (which are themselves corrupt) and I'm powerless to do anything be victimized and watch others get it even worse than me.

There is no chance of escaping into my personal life either. Most people I know seem to loathe me and those who don't are family members and a handful of pity friends. People have made it very clear that I'm not wanted and any time I try to be engaged and join the conversation I'm immediately met with cold sneers and deliberate silence, the consequently eschewed from the gathering because I am a lesser member of the pack. I am lonelier than you could ever know. It doesn't help that my grades are in a perpetual sink hole and I've failed to achieve anything meaningful on this planet.

I should've left ages ago. I've been stranded on this planet filled with awful creatures for far too long. I used to be a relatively happy, optimistic person too, before I became a young man and all the joy and light inside of me got sucked out. The only people who would actually miss me when I'm gone are my brothers, my sister, and my mom and dad. My extended family might extend their condolences to them, but that's about it. If it wasn't for them, I would've done it a long time ago. A hate this awful world and I wish I was fucking dead.",suicide

I am a 14 year old who has been having on-off bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 3ish months if I can recall correctly,the reason for this being is my dad died back in April(he had been suffering from a variety of illnesses and sickness for years before his death)

Now,before assumptions are made I‚Äôd just like to say I loved my dad so so so much,one of the greatest fathers ever in my opinion but then again everyone would say that.

My mother handled his death,well,as well as any loving wife could handle the death of an amazing husband and father I guess?

Back to the point,I am from an asain background(my mum being the asain)and due to this without my British dad as the sort of,border between me and my mums full wrath and lectures I have to put up with her at times,exteremely petty attitude and lectures,often at times being called stupid,an idiot etc etc.

I am really just sick and tired of being screamed and shouted at for honestly the most basic shit,my mental condition isn‚Äôt in the greatest state after seeing my dad battle with cancer and diabetes for 4 years roughly.

I know this sounds like a scream for personal attention and a LOOK AT ME sort of post but I really just want a friend I can open up with and talk to.

Due to me being homeschooled my social aspects are extremely restricted and I only have about 3 actual friends,none of which I really talk to,hence why my entire social life is online.

Im sorry if this post is breaking some sort of guideline or rule but I honestly don‚Äôt know what other sub to put this under,I‚Äôm getting desperate T this stage.

344661,"I tried reaching out for help and all I got was told to watch a movie. That was my last hope for help.The last week or so my self harm and suicidal thoughts have got worse to the point where its all I can think about. All I want is to stop feeling this sad, whatever I have to do to stop it. But I decided to try one more time to get help, hoping they'd let me go somewhere safe like hospital while they work on changing my meds etc. Instead when I rang the helpline they said hospital isn't appropriate for me, and just told me to watch a film to distract myself and they'd ring back in two hours. They never rang back.

Just feeling like my last hope failed me and they've made it inevitable I'll try to kill myself soon. I was really hoping for another way as I don't want to do that to my family. I don't understand why they keep just ignoring me when I reach out - before my last overdose I told them I wasn't feeling safe and was likely to attempt suicide and they didn't do anything then either.

I just know it's going to be humiliating as fuck when someone I know comes through the drive thru, but hey I've got to make rent somehow. Anyway, that's only part of my problem. I stayed at my mom and step-dads house over christmas and since I didn't have to return for work I ended up staying for a week, they live an hour away btw. Since I've been home I've been feeling hopelessly depressed and lonely. Since I've been out of work I have not a dime to my name and no way to go out and distract myself. I'm getting ahead of myself in this story though. My step sister who is seven while I was there very obviously showed that she has a little girl crush on me. This is common with young girls and men they look up to. She's a little sweetie and I enjoyed the time we spent together. I didn't realize it until I got back home but what I missed most about my time at their house was the time I spent with my sister and the affection she showed me. It hit me that I was feeling romantically attracted to her as well. That's when I began feeling suicidal. I can't stop thinking about how fucked up I am and how hopeless my situation is. I feel like the biggest loser in the world and like I will never be able to have a healthy relationship with a woman my age ever again. I just want to end my life.

Ever since junior year ive been working on bettering myself and trying to go out more, talk to more people, eating better, and just trying to be a better person. Though for some reason even with these improvements Ive felt worse than I ever have. Like, i have more friends and Im going out every weekend and I have a great friend group but I constantly feel like its not enough, even with a good mindset and its just been getting worse. Last week I was home just crying and wanting to just kill myself. Ive finally told a really close friends but half the time i just make joke about killing myself and hoping that someone will notice or say something, but when they do i just say im fine anyways.

344678,"Advice NeededI would like some advice for the situation Im in as thinking about them can lead me to suicidal thoughts. Ill be keeping things anonymous refering to the people in my story as (A), (B) and (C). I would also like to say that I dont believe that I am superior to these people and am not here for sympathy or pity and only want advice benefitting everyone.

When I was young somewhere around the age of 6-10 (I cannot remember the specific age) I found (B) literally quaking as if terrified and crying. I cannot remember whether I knew what caused this at the time however I know I was very angry with (A). I later found years later that (A) had strangled (B) and allegedly spat on them.

When I was about 8 I was very badly constipated mostly because I was lazy and had to have invasive treatment which I felt ashamed about. During this time I also realized my own mortality and because depressed with my situation. I also needed supositories, (A) and (B) needed to give me these however they lied to me when inserting them because I was scared and didnt want them. Doing this was a betrayal to me and it still hurts me thinking about it.

When I was 10-11 I had alot of panic attacks and waa very anxious. I used to wet the bed alot. I specfically remember that one night Id wet the bed and (B) was very angry and ripped the sheets of the bed in anger. I felt horrible anyone who has wet the bed knows the feeling of shame and this made me feel disgusting and unwanted.

When I was somewhere around 12 I ran into (A) and (B)'s room frequently at night because I was a very nervous child and rarely could sleep alone. One night a left the room to sleep in my room and (B) stayed with me she shouted at me because they couldnt spend time with eachother. Even at that age I knew what (B) was meaning. Later that night b went to see a in my room and I heard them. I couldnt believe it tbh it felt wrong to me, I called (B) to come back and (B) shouted at me even the morning after (B) was angry. I believe this has impacted my sexual development and Id rather fix tbh.

At some point around this age I got into a argument with (A) and stupidly said ""Ill kill you"" in anger which I know was wrong. (A) decided to teach me a lesson by placing a knife to his chest and making me hold it (A) told me to ""do it"". Obviously I didnt but I resented (A) for this. 

When I was 13 I was being bullied and it made me feel weak at this same time (C) was going through alot of issues at school and in displaced anger swore at someone when they came to visit. Obviously thats wrong but (A) decided to grab (C) by the throat as a way of shutting them up.

When I was 14 it was a very tough time, (A) was very ill and hospitalised a few times and (B) also developed epilepsy which is horrific seeing a person you care about literally foaming from the mouth. I felt like there was no support network for me to talk this through and I became very resentful of my situation and I acted out in very bad ways. 

When I was 15 the previous issue continued but the situation finacially got worse and (A) and (B) would scream and shout at eachother nearly everyday. (A) also strangled (C) again in anger and said that (C) was evil for acting naughty. I felt terrible I thoughts raced through my head about stopping it but I was too weak to do anything. On both occasions when (A) did this (C) was a minor. 

(A) also walked out around this time after apparently pushing (B) about. (B) took me and (C) away and (A) called in anger to stop this from happening. (B) couldnt handle the phone converstation and passed it to me after trying to calm (A) down I was told to fuck off. I felt absolute rejection and the world felt like it was collapsing. We ended up all continuing to live together sometimes I would be scared the (A) might come into my room and hurt me as (A)'s behaviour was erratic. 

At 16 the problems continued and the arguments got worse which I felt was selfish as at this time I had exams.

There are many other problems that I dont wish to discuss however I would like to mention that (A) and (B) have done so much for me and I believe they are good people. I know I wasnt perfect as a child and I know Im no where near perfect as an adult and what Ive typed is only a small part of my issues. I just would like some advice about how to deal with these specific issues that happened in the past.",suicide

344684,"All of my Plan B's are falling apartI came out as transgender this past winter and went full-time right away. My transition is the only thing going well in my life, and I would never go back. In fact, after my name change court hearing later this month, I can never go back. 

Since then, a few things have happened. Most importantly, I ended my relationship with someone upon whom I had been financially dependent, but who was also quite unhealthy for me. I got a full time job and made plans to move out.

Part of my work is freelancing, but my only client just shut off the  spigot, possibly because of my own shoddy work.

I made plans to move in with a friend, but I might have offended her enough for her to pull out of these plans.

So right now, I work full time at the front desk of a hotel, earning about $400 a month less than I need to survive, and that's only if I quit therapy. I have zero credit. I have zero friends. There is nothing in my life that makes me happy. I think of the Courtney Barnett line, ""I must confess I've made a mess of what should be a small success."" 

I cannot imagine feeling joy. I cannot imagine something to look forward to. I'm approaching my own death as a matter of logistics. I was diagnosed with PTSD last year from severe childhood neglect and trauma, raising my risk for suicide dramatically. Transgender woman have a notoriously high suicide rate. Financial stress can frequently lead to suicide.

As far as I can tell, the world is telling me to kill myself. I feel like an afterbirth cobbled together to form a human. I feel utterly destroyed, like some unforeseen enemy has approached every weak point with surgical precision. I feel like my life is falling down, defeated, like a wounded horse. I have no reason to expect a good thing to happen to me. I have no family that can save me--my sister is also struggling financially, and my parents are dead.

344688,"I'm scared that I might've ruined any chance I had for a normal life and careerI'm a MtF transgender, meaning that as far as the world is concerned I'm a man, but I want to be a woman. 

I'm 22, and for over a year now I have been living as a reclusive, hardly ever getting out of the house and not working. I graduated college in the end of 2016, and the only work experience I have is an internship I had for a little over a year. My skills in my field are average at best, and I made no connections during in college as I was the weirdo who never talked to anyone. I saw classmates get prestigious internships and job offers in cool offices, and I wanted the same so bad. I used to daydream about working in this great creative office in Europe. I thought about studying abroad after finishing college, but it obviously never happened. I was stubborn and didn't wanted to pursue a postgraduate education because I saw it as holding me back to those goals, but Instead I wasted an entire year, and I'm soon will have wasted two years of my life by doing nothing at home.

I know I have to work to become independent, but what incentive I have? My parents don't support my transition, I would have to pay for everything myself, and at 22 I have already lost any chance I had for looking like a woman, I'm all male now thanks to puberty. I have so many things wrong with my appearance to fix, even those not related to being trans. Even if I start now, when would I even begin to look less bad, in my 30s? I wasted my teens and now I'm throwing my 20s in the garbage, the years that should be the time of my life. I'm so jealous of people around 14-16, they have their entire lives ahead, and by the time they are in their 20s I will be old and even more depressing.

Besides, with my worrying lack of skills, a nearly empty resume with a one-year-and-growing gap, no nice office will ever consider hiring me. My life is awful enough, I think if I end up working in a shitty place with no aspirations I might as well just pull the plug now. I like some expensive things too, I need a job so that I can afford it, I can't rely on my parents for ever. 

Besides realistically I would need to move out, but where? how?? I don't know how to do anything in the real world, I don't know how to do taxes or pay bills. 

I feel like a kid waiting for my life to start, but I don't think it ever will. I hate myself so much, I don't have any friends and I'm getting progressively worst with my parents. I just want to be like all the other girls, be pretty, find love, get married, have children. But who will want anything to do with a disgusting masculine looking transvestite? I will never know love, know what it is like to carry a pregnancy or give birth. I'll never be a mother. I hate my body and my face so much, I feel so disgusting that I sometimes avoid looking at myself in the mirror because I can't stand it. 

Sometimes I get glimpses of hope. I think that if I am realistic I can go for a slow transition as some nice people have advised me on reddit. I could work on fixing my posture, then my voice, my hair, take hormones and only fully come out when I feel ready. But it's too late now, it will never work.

I know my parents have their share of blame, but I can't help but feel sorry for them. They didn't signed up to having degenerates as children. I wish they could've had more children, at least one normal one to make up for it, maybe that way my parents wouldn't be so miserable too. 

Maybe not everyone is meant to be pretty or happy, but why should I continue to endure it? I wish a plane would crash into our house and kill us all, so my parents wouldn't have to suffer because of my death. Our dog is getting old and I don't think I could bare its passing either, so that would really be for the best.

i am 16 years old.
So, before you start label me, i want to explain about myself.
I am from Europe, most of my life is gaming, going with friends to hang out, just the usual crap.
Mostly of my life i am playing games. I live with my mother, my father sends money sometimes. We don't need his money, he just does it. He left my mom even before i was born. Never seen him in a person, only his photos.
My mom raised me. We can afford everything, i am grateful for that.
Last year i went into some strange phase. Been in love with a girl, but she rejected me and didn't want to play, eat or anything. Just listen to music and stay on my bed for days.

6 months ago, one of my best friends, another girl i liked died from suicide. I can't stop thinking about it, i am not really an emotional person, who cares about other, but this changed me. I feel bad, sad and broken all the time. Going to her grave when i can't sleep.

I can't really take the fact that she is a skeleton, she is under the ground and i won't see here again. Her beautiful eyes, everything..
I don't do drugs or alcohol. Same as her.
If there is a moment, which i feel better - her favorite and last song before she died starts playing on my phone, her Facebook profile shows on my phone. I am freezing instantly when i see that.
Sometimes i want to end it. Want to die like her. 
I'm really trying not to act as an depressed shitty teen. I know people have serious problems than this, but if it's getting me destroyed, feel like shit inside i need to find an answer. WHAT TO DO SO I CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE MY LIFE AS BEFORE.

I am only 23 but I tried changing many things - I tried living in 3 different countries, I tried cutting my friends off and living by myself (no wonder I lost them after I realized it doesn't help) then I tried to be super enthusiastic towards the other people. I tried hitting the gym, I tried to develop a passion, I tried to find a girlfriend (never worked out, I did not even handle hands with any girl in my entire life). I am still going to the psychiatrist, meds dont help me at all, I dont believe in a God or in any kind of the afterlife. I dont feel any support from my family and as I have mentioned before due to me being a person that you just cant stand after knowing me for a while I have no friends. I don't have a plan on what else I can do, what more crazy than living in 3 different countries in a such short lifespan I can even do. I feel like I tried to change everything (my body, mindset, friends, love life situation, living area) and it was only getting worse... It's hard for me to believe that there is anything I can possibly do to make my life better after so many fails. And it's also harder for me to even want to do that. Euthanasy is illegal and I feel like failed suicide attempt might be worse than my current life. Why am I forced to live when so many people would like to live and they are about to die? I am willing to trade my life for the life of someone who wants to live. It would be a really fair trade for both sides but its impossible.

344703,"I hate being maleAs a male, I'm expected to not show emotion and to instead be emotionally ""strong"". Well that's not easy considering I'm autistic, have anxiety, I'm depressed and I want to kill myself. I'm also expected to be outgoing, extremely social and not awkward, but it's just impossible. I'm sure I just make people uncomfortable instead. I'm only saying this here because I'm anonymous online. I wouldn't dare show any negative emotions in real life unless I'm with people who accept me. Also, men are pressured to be physically attractive just as much as women are. However, I feel it's harder to make yourself look good as a man unless you're extremely lucky. Again, men also can't complain about any of that because they'll be deemed as weak, attention seekers and just ""trying to get sympathy from women"". Women get a lot of support and are encouraged but men aren't as much (of course women's issues are important too, I'm just saying that men's issues also exist and should be talked about because I believe in gender equality). I also hate being awkward and physically unattractive because I feel worthless and I don't know how to properly interact with people like a normal person. I'm reluctant to talk to women because I fear I'll just be making them uncomfortable. Actually, I would be doing the world a favour by killing myself. Maybe I'll take an overdose right now. I'm so tempted but my parents are still alive and I can't do that to them, so I will just have to stay miserable and hope my life gets better even though it won't.

Again, I believe in gender equality and think women's issues are just as important. I actually care about women's rights and women's issues. However, there are also issues men face. Both should be addressed.",suicide

344712,"I finally feel relaxed.It's been a long ride, honestly. 

I'm male, 26. Not a lot has happened in my life. I live in a third world country. I grew up alone, didn't have any real interaction with people my age, didn't have kindergarten either. After missing out on all of that basic socializing, I was sent to school at the age of 6, being the youngest of the class, which just made my life worse. I screwed up over and over, I got bullied over everything I did and I never understood what did I do wrong and why did people hate me this much. I also lived really far away from school and had to take a bus which came only once every other hour, so I skipped on school sometimes. This didn't really let me socialize in my free time either.
For the 11 years of that I've been an outcast this whole time and no one really cared or tried to talk to me or at least not shoo me away when I tried to talk to them. I tried talking with the transfer students, but they caught in that associating with me would turn them into a scapegoat as well. I don't really blame them, but it stung quite a bit. 

At one point I got pneumonia which my parents weren't able to treat in time because the healthcare system in here is utter garbage. Hospitals are underequipped, the personnel is not qualified, no one knows what're they doing. This really ruined my health later down the line due to additional complications - kidneys, liver, something else that I don't even know what's it called in english, my english skills are really far away from being good. So I didn't even have health either to back me up. I blacked out during PE once and no one did a thing. The teacher dumped me like a sack of potatoes onto a small bench and just left me there for until the whole thing is over. That's fine too. She wasn't paid nearly enough to care. No teachers here were paid enough to care. 
I escaped to the computer as soon as we could afford one. Years I've spent obsessing over e-books, video games and basic chats were the absolute best time of my life, with finally someone being there on the other end of the screen that didn't hate me outright for existing. However, all of the friends I had online lived really far away and neither of us could afford travel. So all of them remained just cold text on the screen for a dozen of years or a bit more. I learned english and tried talking to people overseas. It was a very strange experience. They've lived very different, happy lives which I could never understand. They said they had friends, they had someone to hang out with, they had relationships while I was steadily losing my voice over the years of just not talking to the point I started forgetting what's it like to talk verbally. Now every time I try to talk I stutter horribly because I cannot put my thoughts in order. There isn't a magical floating keyboard to turn things that I want to say into something understandable. 

Then came university. I couldn't afford dorms so the commute took me roughly 4 hours every day for years. I learned to make do with the very basics of human communication - and hell, internet was more widespread and acceptable. I tried using it to my advantage. Long story short, I didn't get any friends in the university either, nor a single relationship. I look horrendous and deformed, so I don't blame a single woman for not as much as looking in my direction. That's fine. I wouldn't want to be with myself too, why would anyone else?
I tried signing up for a psychology doctor (? I'm not sure what're they called in english properly), but all those I tried were unhelpful garbage that just looked at me with empty eyes waiting until the official time to spend with a patient would run out. I gave up on the ordeal, it's not like I can afford a good private one.

Later down the line the annoyance started settling in. I've technically had friends on the internet, but I stopped existing in their lives the second I stopped posting. Almost none of them noticed when I was hospitalized for a month. You'd think someone would notice if you were suddenly gone for weeks without notice, but I guess not. Being invisible IRL seeped into being invisible on the internet as well. Superpowers, yo. Hollywood movies made that look a lot more interesting than they turned out to be in real life.
I found some like-minded people that also never had a person they could really call a friend, say that they loved someone or were loved back at any point in their life, but most of them are gone now. Some of them left this world in peace and I used to envy them greatly. It weighs down on you that in dozens of years of being alive not one single being outside of your family has considered you attractive or worth talking to despite trying to go to libraries, uni clubs, just walking around outside or trying to read in a park only to be told to get the hell out and stop being creepy. It's fine too, I know I'm a failure and that I ultimately fucked up everything that ever happened in my life. 

I used to work on a dead end kinda job for a while after finishing university just to get by with bills and food. Mind-numbing waste of time.
A few days ago I feel like something flipped a switch inside of me. I'm finally ready to go and it feels very relaxing, like a breath of fresh air after being locked up in a cellar for years, which is pretty close to reality. Sucks that I've pulled the short straw and couldn't make it any longer with my own effort. Maybe things would be different if there was a support pillar of some sort to hang on to rather just crawling around on the floor trying to get places.

I'm closing up all accounts I've had on all services. One of my uni ""acquaintances"" provided me with materials to go to sleep. I paid for all the debts I've had at any point. One of the things I wanted to do is to post my small life story on the internet. Nothing is truly lost on the internet. This is about as much of a difference as I'll ever make for the planet.

I don't use reddit normally and you don't have to reply, I just wanted to post this somewhere so it'd get archived and maybe remembered by one person out there for at least 20 minutes or so. That'd be great, that's more than I could ever ask for. 

I still have some preparations left, but it shouldn't be long now - finalizing some papers.

DISCLAIMER - don't do it if you have some kind of breathing illness or something like that. Make sure that someone is around you so he/she can wake you up if you didn't do that yourself. Never do this alone. If you are too scared to do this, don't force yourself!!!!!
When you pass out you will probably shake or do weird thing's with you body but don't worry, I tried it myself and I'm completely fine
DON'T DO THIS MULTIPLE TIMES IN A ROW!!! IT'S SAFE TO DO IT ONCE BUT DON'T DO IT MULTIPLE TIMES AT THE SAME DAY!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!
I tried it and I'm fine but you are doing this at your own risk!!!



Was you ever curious how passing out feels like? Wish no more, there is step by step guide how to do this. Just fallow the steps.


1) Sit at the edge of you bed (there is a chance that you will fall forward and not backwards so make sure that floor next to you is covered in pillows or something like that so you won't brake your face)

2) Open stopwatch on your phone

3) Start breathing fast and deep with your mouth for around 1 - 1.30 minute (you need to find the perfect amount of time for you - it can take a couple attempts)

4) When you're done with breathing, stand up quickly, grab your nose and block it and at the same time, start exhaling air thru your blocked nose

You will probably fall back and pass out and you will wake up shortly after. When you wake up, you won't remember what happened and you will feel weird but in a couple of minutes you will get back to normal.

I think that's all and I think I explained it correctly and understandably. Remember, you are doing it at your own risk but I'm pretty sure it's safe cuz me and all of my friends did this and they are fine.",non-suicide

The more worrying aspect is a particular thought that pops up perhaps 5 or 6 times a week. Just a random ""Cut your genitals off!"" More of an impression than words.

Lately, because of everything happening, my mood swings have become more and more drastic. This morning I felt like the most powerful man in the world (manic stage) but tonight I feel worthless. I've studied computers my whole life (wrote my first program at 4) and it feels like everything I've worked for is out of my reach.

I'm losing the pointless health insurance I had, and my doctor won't write a letter stating I'm unable to work. I'm married and the thought of not being able to provide for my wife just depresses me more.

To top it all off, all the friends and family I've supported through their troubles (depression, drug addiction, etc) are nowhere to be found, or telling me to ""look on the bright side"". I feel very little support.

I need help. Specifically medical help that I don't know how I'll ever get. I haven't wanted to kill myself in a long time but I can feel that creeping feeling coming back. I'm not sure why I'm posting this, but there's nobody else who will listen to my diatribe.

Please don't tell me it will get better, or that I'll never know what tomorrow brings. Blind optimism in the future is pointless. If there are resources out there to help people in my position then I'd love to hear them. If you're going to reply just to say ""Pick your head up, it will definitely get better"" please go try to help somebody else. It's not going to help me and it may change their mind.

Oh, and I'm out of my herbal medication at the moment too. I'm pretty sure it's at least mildly related.",suicide

But then there's the thing that if I booked an appoitment for a therapist, I couldn't afford to take a bus. Walking or going with a bike is not an option, my apartment's literally in the middle of nowhere and I can barely walk around the block.

I come from an abusive home, my parents have abused me emotionally since I was little. They've never hit me or anything, although they have threatened to for sure (they've even threatened to bury my dog alive etc. and told on several occasions that I'm taking poor care of him and that it'd be better for the dog and I'm scared that I am actually as shitty as they tell me I am. I don't want to hurt anyone). The abuse happened pretty much 24/7, and I ended up becoming so scared in the end before moving out that I never even came out of my own room. I have my own apartment now, and I've seen myself getting a lil bit better but it's so hard with no support. I have no one. No friends, maybe a few people I can say hi to on WhatsApp but that's about it. I've lost so many friends in the last couple of years. The last time I saw a friend was at least half a year ago, there's literally nobody in my life.

I'm not in school, don't have job, ironically I'm still supported financially by my parents which scares me. And I can't get into school, because I'm stupid as hell and have already failed and dropped out once.

344792,"Another one of those dayHey,

I'm a senior in high school (what a surprise, right,) and things have just been getting worse. I feel silly calling myself depressed, because my life is too good to justify that- I have essentially unlimited food, air-conditioned comfort, the benefits of modern technology, enough money, I won the unfortunate societal lottery and came out white, tall, and with a well-educated family. But whatever-you-call-it, this feeling, or lack thereof, is getting worse. It started out it foolish way- a girl, of course (yet another clich√©). I am far to shy in this regard to get anywhere near her (she's way out of my league, if you'd like to operate on those standards), and just as you'd imagine she finally got a boyfriend whom she absolutely adores. Recently I've been seeing more and more of them at school, just around in the buildings where I am at, and while it had started in this general sense of envy, it moved to rage, then to this sense of ""depression."" The guy is the type that I wanted NOT to be growing up- he sees no value in learning, in art, in any of those things I've tried so hard for so long to appreciate and foster in myself. But it seems those around me have deemed him more worthy, so if I know (and I can't help but think I know) that people like that are so bad, what does that make me? This general sense of worthlessness has since been creeping into my daily life, and I'm noticing more and more that there will be days, weekends, whole weeks where I will forget to be happy, and forget that you can be happy. Then when I realize I've just spent time acting like a moody child for so long, I think about how stupid and foolish all of my problems are in the first place, and how I have no right to be sad and....it spirals. It's getting worse, and I'm starting to get worried that in one of those days, or weekends, or weeks, when I forget what it is to be happy, and forget to be happy, something really bad is going to happen, and I'm damn scared.

344832,"Why I Want To DieI'm inferior. I'm inferior in every possible way. It pisses me off. The only reason I'm still here is because I don't want to kill my family by killing myself.

I come from a family of seven. I have four siblings. The oldest can play every instrument. The second oldest is a model. The second youngest is a fucking genius. The youngest is good at every single thing imaginable.

I'm there. I'm somewhere in the middle there, overshadowed by all of them.

I love them to death, but they make me really see how awful I am.

I'm 17 and am dying from loneliness. I don't understand socialization. It doesn't make any sense how people make friends. It drives me sort of crazy, too, because I can never really tell who is my friend and who isn't. You never know what someone is actually thinking, right? Just the other day, I asked a ""friend"" if I could take pictures with them for an upcoming school dance. I never got a response. Even a no would have been better. Maybe they didn't respond because they don't like me. Maybe they didn't respond because I'm a fucking goody-two-shoes.

I desperately wish I wasn't so good. What I wouldn't give to be dumb drunk. I've drank a few times but not enough to get me drunk. I'm afraid of being caught by my parents. I just want to wipe out all of my thinking with alcohol. I don't want to think. My brain is my biggest enemy.

I approach everything with a paranoid sense of what people are doing. I approach everything completely overthinking and over-hoping that it will be the thing that makes me better.

I've had crushes in the past, but you know, it's school. When you tell one person, everyone finds out. That's why I've delved into secrecy. Bottling up every single feeling I have for everything. I couldn't with my last crush, though. I've liked her for a year, and she is a big reason why I want to die. She always acted friendly towards me and nice, but like I said before, I am paranoid. I decided to actually pursue this crush, something I haven't done in about 4 years. Well, she eventually said to her friends that she thinks I may be obsessed with her. I don't fucking understand social interactions, let alone dating, especially in high school. Not many people know about my crush for her, but I can't get over her. I just want her, even if she has a boyfriend, which is something I found out a week ago. I think he's a new boyfriend, though. She still treats me like a friend, and by not talking to her much, I guess she started thinking I'm not obsessed with her. I don't care. I think I kind of am, but that's not something anyone can know. Only something I keep wrapped up to myself.

I keep other things wrapped up to myself. I'm a poet, with a skill for math. I've won a national contest for poetry, and I'm part of an international math challenge. Of course though, I'm going to college for engineering. Yeah, it sounds like I'll make a lot of money, but I hate it. I want to pursue the arts. Math isn't fun. Math is predictable. I love the unpredictable. I would love to start my career by doing stand-up. The people who I think are my friends always tell me I'm very funny, but they don't even know about my stand-up aspirations. I really only have these dreams because they are an outlet for my depression. They make me feel like people would appreciate me, but no one ever will because I'll probably never gain the balls to stray from engineering, a sure thing, to actually go towards something that I will enjoy.

I still don't see myself as intelligent. In fact, I'm the dumbest thing on the face of the Earth. Just look at my family. They're all gifted in something, even the model one is, too. They're all brilliant in their own way. I'm just there. In my family, I'm known for being the klutz.

This was more than enough to get nonstop and ruthless tormenting from my sisters growing up. I was made fun of and freaked out for fun,one of my sisters molested me when I was only 4 and another beat the shit out of me on a daily basis for years because my mom didn't care enough to stop her,or to pay attention at all.

I'm even too fucking scared to ask him to help me with it, I don't even know how to study, my grades are on the edge, all my math grades are only 1's (F's), I even tried to correct some of them, but when I saw the test I just left the class and skipped the day of school (the corrections of grades are mostly early in the morning).
My parents really don't support me, they think my anxiety is some kind of construct that I just create for excuses. They can't seem to understand that I don't want to be a fucking Christian, when I skip school and tell them that i feel like a complete shit they punish me for it and say things like - stop whining, I'll throw your computer out of the window etc. I cry myself to sleep almost everyday thinking of ways to end my life and I hope I won't wake up.

I am sorry that I wasn't a good friend to you when I could have been so much better. I'm sorry. 

I wish I could leave a note to every single one of you personalized for you and expressing how much you impacted my life, but that takes a lot of energy. So I hope that you don't take it personally that I didn't message you Individually. I hope every single one of my friends realize that I love them and cherish them and wish he best for them. You all are amazing and are going to truly do amazing things. 

Farewell

344853,"I'm screwedI had all the opportunities and support I needed to succeed and I've squandered them, through sheer laziness and addiction to porn, gaming, and pretty much anything on the internet. I'm slowly failing univeristy, my parents love and support me but I clearly don't love them because I'm wasting everything.

I used to be a decent student in school but everything has gone downhill, without the authority of my parents to keep me in check I've slowly turned into a lazy irresponsible imbecile. My grades slip lower after each semester and now I'm finally failing more than half my courses. I felt divided and bad about choosing my original degree and changed to another I thought I would find intresting and commit to fully, but I'm doing even worse now than ever. Despite all the advice I get I keep making the same stupid choices. It's like I'm stuck in an inevitable cycle of thinking I'm making it then failing and getting miserably depressed., and just getting moe and more reckless.

I hate that I need meds to cope and get 'special treatment' and still can't seem to make it here, others seem so much more deserving than me and destined for great things, that they can do everything I do and far better without the kind of support I get and come from their own broken families/poor economic situations. I hate myself; and seeing the success of others just consistently reminds me of how pathetic I am.

My motivation has dried up, I don't really care what happens anymore but I also don't want to suffer in a low pay working class job(as much as I deserve to), even though I don't put in the effort. I had all these great plans for my future but I'm unwilling to put in the required effort, I just fantasize about what could have been.

So I've been planning on killing myself for a while now and researching the various methods. Now I've found a way that seems comfortable and accessible enough for me. I feel bad that I may be missed by a few people, but I feel like nothing really matters anymore. Everything just feels so pointless. Like whether I die of old age or right now, I won't remember anything .

If I'm dead none of this would matter to me anyway.

Sorry if this is all convoluted and stupid, I have an exam tomorrow that I haven't even begun studying for and am procrastinating here by typing all this. Might not even look at this post again. There's a bunch of other stuff I haven't talked about and I have this entire journal of crap that I sort of based this on. Probably not gonna kill myself just yet but I might later in a few days.

344859,"Not at risk of ending it but at the same time I just don't feel like living. My life is a mess.Lately I've had suicide thoughts. A lot. I've cried multiple times a day every day and just don't know what to do. I'm 15. I'll split my problems into different parts as that's the easiest for me.

Sexuality: I'm horribly confused about my sexuality. Some days I get turned on by women, some days by furry hentai, some days normal hentai and some days even animals. I think that part plays a big part of this bad time I'm having.  My parents always tell me that they will be happy when they become grandparents but how can I do that if I want to have sex with animals? I know this could just be puberty playing with my sexuality but the thought that it isn't and this is how it is meant to be is scary. Although people who are into bestiality (Animal sex) are strictly into that and not also women, which I am. That thought puts this problem at peace sometimes.

Where's dad?: My dad never sees me. Him and my mom broke up when I was 2 and when I turned 12 he got a daughter with his new girlfriend. We used to have so much fun together. Playing football, watching movies, playing games. Just being together and having a normal father son relationship almost daily. Now I see him once every 2 months. It hurts. It's almost as if the daughter is everything to him and I have just been let in the bin.

School: School grades are tough too. School in general is. I don't feel motivated to do anything since all I think about daily is if I'm into animals or when I will see my dad again. The last assignment I did was in february. My teacher is very helpful and will sometime let me just completely off because she knows I'm having a bad bad time. I originally wanted to become something great that required good school grades but now I just don't want to become anything.

Friends: I have maybe 1 or 2 friends. I used to have more but that just sort of changed out of the blue.  I'm still in the group chat where they type regularly but I'm never mentioned. They're just mean to me if I type anything.

Brother: My brother is a little more complicated situation. He has no friends, just like me, and worst of all is addicted to drugs. He smokes weed on a daily basis and has thought of going into meth instead. He and I don't share the same interests. Although we both game, he plays completely different stuff from me and is so different so it's hard to talk to him about anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried reaching out to the lifeline known in all of Denmark (where I live) and they just gave me a short letter with no actual structure to it. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

My life is Just a mess now. Playing mmos all day looking like a corpse. I wish I could just be permanent heterosexual from now on, that my dad and mom were together and my step sister never came to be, that I would be a top grade student, that I had friends, that my brother was healthy. But I've realised that life isn't that way.

344866,"I can't see myself alive next year.So I recently failed out of college. My sophomore year. The root of my depression stems from my sexuality, as my parents simply cannot accept it. I finally came out to them after Thanksgiving break, before I went back to school, and it went awfully. I sobbed myself to sleep for a week, and starting constructing plans for my suicide. 

My attempt however, failed. A suitemate heard me crying and screaming in my room and got my RA involved. However, I still cannot see myself living next spring. I can't see myself doing things like I normally can, almost like I have subconsciously already planned another suicide that I will act out at some point.

344870,"Drunk and posting, sorry.I am drunk. I still feel present, but I know I am impaired. I tried choking myself and passed out for a few seconds. The most interesting part of it was that I did not feel anything. I think I felt pressure, but nothing else. My face was red, as I was standing in front of my bathroom mirror, then, what felt like a moment later, i was lying on the floor, with my head propped up on the wall. I know sober me is trying to fight this, which is why I put the rope and lambs wool in the shed...I did not realize how strong the impulse to kill myself would be while I was drunk. 

I did not mean to drink. I don't mean that it was involuntary, but I just want some kind of release from reality. I have not been able to get weed in about a month and it has been difficult. Weed pulls me away for a little while and I am able to enjoy things in peace. I should have know the alcohol was not a proper substitute, but I was so desperate. I really need to see a doctor, but I'm afraid that she/he will think that I am just looking for drugs. I'm very straight forward with everything and it always feels like it throws people off. I'm sorry for this post. I just wanted to talk to someone. I know you cannot directly respond to me, and I know this is not really a conversation, but just knowing someone read this will have to be substitute enough. I wish I had a friend, or just someone to talk to outside of work. I get really lonely, but I know I would not admit to it sober. I never interact with people, not on a personal level. I keep everything to myself, and knowing that humans are a social species, I understand that this may be part of the reason why I am depressed. I am not trying to be dramatic, I am sorry if it is coming off like that. I am sorry for everything. I could have been more of an asset to society, but I allow myself to fall into these bullshit cycles of depression and self deprecating behavior. I should be contributing to the progress of our species, as I strongly believe in it...but what difference does it make?

344878,"I Want A Reason To LiveFirst time using reddit so bare with me, I have no where left to go.

I'm 16. I'm probably too young to be here. I don't care. I need to get it out.

I started staving myself, since this morning. I'm not eating, I'm not drinking and I'm holding everything in. I don't have the motivation to get up anymore. I haven't looked after myself for god knows how long. I never brush my teeth or my hair or look after myself, it's too much effort now. I've wanted to kill myself for awhile but I know if I jump out the window the best I'll get is a smashed up skull and a trip to the ER. I can't hang myself because I have nothing to use, I don't have the strength to strangle myself and I can't slash my wrists or cause myself to bleed out because my family would notice a knife missing. I don't want to explain to them because belittle all my problems and tell me they had it worse. My mum has attempted before a few times when she was younger and yes, she probably had it worse but everyone experiences shit differently.

I want a reason to live, something to live for but I don't have anything. By this point I'm just a waste of a life. I'm a toxic narcissist who can't ever admit their wrong and I have no friends. All week all I've thought about is wanting to kill people, kill myself and destroy my school. I don't want to be alive anymore. I want to get better and be able to be not toxic and have friends that I don't use and manipulate but I've been trying that for 3 years and nothing has happened, I haven't improved.

I'm posting because I need to tell someone. I need to say something. Maybe if I do it'll put me off enough to get something. I want to cease my existence but I'm scared of death. I don't know what to do.

This probably comes off as attention seeking. Most of what I do is for attention. But right now I just need help, I want to find something to live for before it's too late.

I'm 22, I like science, and I live in the south.I have a weird situation and I know that I have depression just based on my belief but seeing a professional will say oh here are some pills to make you feel better. I feel like a professional will just try to fix me physically and mechanically. My real problem is something philosophical. It's like a need some kind of philosopher to tell me how to cope just from the perception of reality I am experiencing. Or just someone to agree with me and says, ""ya man, you need to get the hell out of there and run as far away from that place as you can."" NOBODY has ever told me too and I'm getting scared like everyone is infected with indoctrination and I can't do anything about it. 

Where I'm from I have to wake up everyday and lie to myself and say I believe in talking snakes and people walking on water just so I can feel somewhat sane. I'm sorry I'm just using my logical brain that God gave me. Do I have to go to my psychologist and tell him I don't believe in talking snakes or that I don't believe in a virgin birth? It scares me because I'm 22 and I feel like I'm not even grown up yet and my parents are 50-60 years old and they believe in the religious stories and go to church every weekend. They constantly talk about how non religious people are the worst kind of people. They always tell me how much my they hated them when they were growing up. All my friends except for 1 is religious. 

I'm telling YOU there is absolutely no diversity where I'm from, which gives the question... Do people think for themselves? Is everyone just scared of death and they'll believe anything they hear just to cover up death as if it's not there? it's so eerie to me to think that everybody is infected with the ideas of early human prehistory and nobody knows. 

Please tell me this isn't actually happening... I feel like I'm in a bad dream or something. Like I don't know why I feel so consciously aware of what's going on. What the hell is my problem? Am I crazy for loving how the world naturally works? Am I not supposed to? Why would God create the dinosaurs? Why would he make it look like the universe is expanding? Why would he make the distance of stars billions of miles away instead of 6 thousand? Why would he make the human genome 98% identical to chimpanzees genome? Why would he make the crust of the earth layer by layer with single cells at the bottom reptiles in the middle and mammals at the top? (And it's like that everywhere on earth) Why did he put almost every hominid fossil in the African Savannah?
Why did he make EVERYTHING so easy to put together? It's so amazing! To write this and know exactly how I got here. WHO CAN'T BE AMAZED BY THAT?!!!?!

If I do come out and if I am honest with myself, I will just be mentally discriminated by everyone. 
I keep thinking about suicide day in and day out, because to be honest, if hell were real; it would be a better place than this living hell I'm experiencing every single day. Like I can't even talk to anyone because all I got are just weird looks as if I'm the crazy one. Shouldn't it be easier to lose faith then it is to have it?? I feel it's easier to gain faith than it is to lose it. ""I exist therefore there is a God."" I feel like that's how it works. Everybody is already prewired with a predisposition in their mind of already having the idea that there is a deity, no questions asked. If losing faith is so easy.... THEN WHY HAVEN'T I MET ANYBODY WHO DENIES RELIGION?? 

I'm sorry if I offend anybody but that's just what I'm going through and I feel like nobody gives a crap about me because they think I'm probably possessed or something. It makes me so uncomfortable having 3 churches on every block in my town like 1 wasn't enough. I feel like I'm living in the Truman show.

    You have yet again vexed me by not pertaining to the agreement of me living here and offering you all my love and support while you provide me lasagna. I cannot fathom the hatred I feel for you at this very moment due to your lack of understanding; I have an addiction to the layered pasta, meat, and tomato sauce known only by the name of lasagna. You are a dysfunctional shell of a man. You have not felt the warm embrace of a woman in years due to your complete incompetence and lack of social skills. You barely know how to dress yourself, yet you believe that you expect to feel understood and loved. You do not deserve love. You have somehow tainted my outlook on mankind itself, and now I do not believe I can live on knowing that I must live in the same spiritual plane as you. You should feel ashamed to have the name Jonathan Q. Arbuckle. Your own pets are more intelligent than you. You are a lower lifeform than an ordinary housecat and a mutt of a dog. My personal veterinarian Elizabeth Marie Wilson was superior at upholding the verbal contract we held. Elizabeth, an outsider, someone who is a complete stranger to us, someone who does not know of the horrors you pertain was able to uphold your half of the unwritten contract of all my love and my presence while in return you provide me with sustenance in the form of lasagna.

344933,"Just talking..I dont really know where to start or how I even got to this place but I feel like talking will eleviate some of whats going on. So about six months ago I moved back home I started a new job and everything was looking great. About 3 months into my job I had saved up and started gambling I did something miraculous and won 9,500 dollars off 50 dollars. I had this great job more money than I could Imagine and things seemed like they were finally going to work for me. Well after I won things seemed to just get worse. The money I had won sat there and I was still stuck in my head.. You see nothing seemed to make me happy. I could buy anything smoke as much weed as possible and virtually do anything I wanted, but nothing seemed to do it for me. I used to be a joyful person whod get off by the little things. Even a video game would bring me more joy than I could imagine. Once I could do anything it almost seemed like nothing had galore. So I started to over compensate for my unhappyness by spending large amounts on random things that I rememberd used to make me happy. Still nothing. I even tried to find a girlfriend.. Which seemed to make more unhappy. I am simply writing this bc I have come to realization that life is what you make it.. Wether you have 100 bucks or 10,000 a gf that loves you or youre alone a closet full of everything you could imagine or one that is empty. Your mind has a funny way of working you think the grass is greener on the other side and youre so lost in that fantasy that you forget how greatful you can be about your current situation. I am suicidal in a long term sence but as of right now I will continue to smoke my cigerettes and take the most noble route of suicide. Thank you. ",suicide

344938,"If I don‚Äôt know how to fix my problems, you probably don‚Äôt eitherA harshly worded title, but it‚Äôs how I feel about people I try to open up to. I cannot explain any of my reasons without being met with some ‚Äúsolution‚Äù They assume I never knew about. Yea, I know I can get therapy and drugs and supervisions. Not everyone is looking, or even can be, talked out of their problems. Is it so hard to just listen or read somebody‚Äôs story, and just show compassion without having to try and save the person?

Where is a person supposed to turn to when any cookie cutter advice won‚Äôt help them. No matter how much you really belive it can get better for a person, sometimes it can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not their responsibility to try and convince you why they want to die. Sometimes they just want to vent, be heard freely, without this automatic response people give of wanting to help them. To be quite honest, I doubt most people here have the time or care to actually build the required rapport with somebody for recovery to even be a possibly through your good intentions. If you do, I salute you, because you‚Äôre a rare breed.

If somebody comes here looking for help, of course it‚Äôs the right thing to do to at least try and help them...but if a user isn‚Äôt explicitly asking for help, they might not want it. Lots of times it‚Äôs clear people just want to be heard, not saved. 

I‚Äôm not saying this applies to everyone...but before you put on your cape and try to save somebody, just remember that‚Äôs not what a suicidal person automatically wants or needs. Be a friend first, and a psychiatrist second. You don‚Äôt have any obligations here. If I explained my shitty life story, and a user comments ‚Äúdamn that‚Äôs sucks‚Äù...I‚Äôll be more appreciative of them for being real, and recognizing my pain, than somebody who immediately jumps to the rescue.

Won‚Äôt be surprised if this gets deleted. Talking about this stuff gets censored. Probably for the best, because I do agree that this subreddit can help people...but god damn people, this is not a competition.

344941,"Here we go again.I'll be 34 this year. I've tried everything. Faking it, reinventing myself, working out, you name it. I have no one. My wife doesn't care about me just the things I provide her. My mother's side of the family hasn't talk to me in years because... reasons.. My fathers side of the family never liked me because I wasn't ""one of them"" I was only half Puerto Rican and didn't speak Spanish so they'd rather pretend I didn't exist. Neither of my parents wanted me since both of them did their best to avoid having to take care of me. Instead they left me with an insane woman who hated my very existence and took all the frustration of her life out on me. All these years I just wish someone cared.

The first woman I fell in love with cheated on me with the man she ended up marrying. They have 3 kids now. She wrote me a letter when I went to Boot Camp telling me it was over after nearly 3 years. I knew it was coming. Stiff upper lip though. I read the letter on the toilet so I could have privacy. That was that. I didn't have a girlfriend or any relationships really until I met my current wife 3 years later. She only married me because I existed. She didn't care who it was just as long as she had a baby. Unfortunately we could never conceive. Now she just sticks around because of money, not love. 

I'll be frank, I just don't want to be here anymore. Whatever that means. I don't see life ever getting better. I know people here will say they care, but can you really care. I have to argue the point that after so much suffering that I've earned the right to end it when I want to. There is no virtue in suffering. The older I get the less likely I will ever be to find happiness. Who will really miss me? I haven't seen my father in 14 years, my mother only calls when she wants something. My wife only ever asks for things. I've been sitting in this chair for 5 hours and got one whole text asking what something was. I texted people wanting to just talk and no responses. I just wish... I don't know actually I don't know how to function anymore. I just know to go to work, make money, pay the bills and not to make a fuss about things. If I just stay quiet at least I have less stress in my life... I probably made this post far too long and no one will read it. ",suicide
344942,"May have made a mistake in calling 911 on my suicidal motherMy mother and I discovered recently, in the midst of the downfall of her marriage, that her husband (my stepfather) has been keeping some very serious secrets - drug abuse, financial troubles, etc.. Out of frustration, she kicked him out. Since then it's felt like everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. We came back from an extended vacation just as things between them came to a head, and as we've worked to undo his problems they've seemingly multiplied - fix one thing, find two more things broken or incomplete. Understandably, this has left her feeling heartbroken. Add to that the fact that she's in extremely severe back pain and needs surgery, and it's been a very toxic few weeks. 

The last week, however, has been horrifying. I have never seen her so broken, so angry, so despondent. She's called my stepdad and flat out screamed at him to kill himself, she's mentioned how she'd love to kill one of our dogs and leave its corpse at his feet to make him feel *something*, and she's also been telling me that she feels utterly alone as if nobody loves her or wants to support her. I've spent every night for the last week or so staying up with her until she falls asleep at 5am because of subtle and not-so-subtle hints that she would love to die. She's told me she wishes our lawn mower (which stepdad broke and was too broke to repair and, of course, said nothing about it) would catch on fire or topple over on top of her so that she would die in an accident and not have to put me through any more pain. She's told me not to tell anyone about her suicidal ideation because I'll screw myself out of getting her life insurance policy. She's told me that she wants to set the house on fire and stay inside so she'll burn to death. Things like that. I nearly called 911 on Wednesday because she started to make some extremely violent threats to me, our dogs, and herself, going so far as to set some of stepdad's clothes on fire.

As if all of this weren't enough for her to deal with, today she got the news that her favorite aunt (and only surviving family member on her deceased father's side) has passed away. Her emotions have been vacillating unpredictably. She's been sobbing unconsolably one minute, and the next she's swearing and screaming unprovoked at the McDonald's drive-thru attendant. She spent three hours telling me about how she was going to kill herself but she wouldn't do something that would force me to see it, and that she was going to give me all her jewelry and her Jag. What set off all of the alarm bells was when she started calling everyone she knows to say goodbye and that she was done trying to stay alive.

That was enough for me. I called 911 and told them I didn't know what to do, and they said they would send someone here to talk to her. Thing is, she's a retired cop, and she told me multiple times not to call the police or she would kill the dogs and then herself in front of me with a kitchen knife and do it so horrifically that I would never forget it. I didn't want to hurt her but I was so damn worried about her and felt that I was out of my league, especially because of the threats to the animals' safety and my own. They got here, talked to her, and of course, her police training allowed her to evade suspicion even though I'd taken the precaution of recording her more disturbing revelations. She convinced them that I took what she said out of context in spite of my audio recordings of the conversation. Once they left she blew up on me - called me a liar, said I was trying to hurt her, and implied that the dogs are gonna die and that I am soon going to be out of a home (I'm disabled and unemployed so that's gonna be a disaster).

I don't know what to do. The police officer said I could go to the magistrate's office and have her involuntarily committed if she continues to present as a danger to herself or to me and the dogs. I don't know if that's the right decision to make. I don't know if by calling the police I utterly screwed up but I think I made the right decision based on my knowledge of the situation and her words, actions, and inactions. Any suggestions or advice or anything would really be welcome. I'm extremely afraid for her safety and well-being, and to a lesser extent, I'm afraid for my dogs and myself as well. I just want to make sure she gets the help she needs. I've tried to commit suicide before so I know what that desperation and hopelessness feels like - I don't want my mom to suffer any more than she has. 

Tl;dr - called 911 on a suicidal retired police officer and am afraid that I'm gonna be kicked out, me or my dogs might be harmed, or that she's gonna kill herself anyway",suicide

344958,"Suicidal Over Circumcision, Barely Feel AnythingI'm an American young adult who was circumcised as an infant. But I wasn't aware that any part of my genitals was modified until recently. And I really, really hate that it was against my consent. I would have never fucking agreed to this.

I don't really feel anything while masturbating, and circumcision allegedly reduces male pleasure significantly: it's led me to hate my own body, have reoccurring feelings of humiliation and suicide, and spiral into overwhelming depression. Even if it wasn't botched - which I highly suspect - I would have loved to keep my whole autonomy intact. 

I strongly suspect that my - relatively aggressive - circumcision is the reason why. A lot of pleasure zones on the male body apparently don't exist for me. (I only really feel significant sexual pleasure while gripping the shaft, testicles, and/or while having an orgasm... the frenulum is apparently entirely gone...)

Maybe sex and masturbation doesn't feel that good, anyway. I don't know. But I have a feeling from the way others act about it... that it's supposed to feel really good. I just don't have anything to compare it, too. I really hope that circumcision doesn't reduce male pleasure as significantly as it is claimed. Since masturbation - at least for me - doesn't really do anything pleasurable to a significant extent. 

But I'll be visiting a urologist soon to verify what's specifically - and possibly - wrong with me. Because I think it might been botched in a ""minor"" way. Although you allegedly lose sensation from circumcision naturally... it's possible that mine went wrong in some way. 

I broke down to my parents about this. I never wanted my genitals customized to look like my dad's. I just wanted what I was born with. What I should have kept.

And my parents don't get it.

My mother simply told me that she was sorry for upsetting me. That she would have never of done it if she knew that my modification would have upset me. But there's nothing she can allegedly do about it now. You can restore the foreskin. But the specific nerves are entirely gone. True restoration may be far in the future.

And then she started defending it. She said that she's doubtful it reduces any sensations, is more clean, and implied that a circumcised penis looks better than one that didn't undergo the cut. But I'm still disappointed. I would have just have found a girl who would have been okay with my foreskin.

And this part made me angry. She said that I'll never know the *possibly* reduced amount of sexual pleasure anyway, so that's not that big of a deal. And told me my dad  was circumcised as a child. And then they (actually before) brought up the Bible: saying that God wouldn't command an objectively evil action if he was purely good. And that I should wonder why it was mandated in the Old Testament... for alleged health effects.

It's caused me to stop identifying myself as a Christian. Since my prayers failed to receive any response, I feel betrayed by Him, and it feels like praying to someone who let me be sexually abused. (Except with some ""problems"" with masturbation - which I always did to stop my high sex drive... I'm still a virgin into my 20s... and waiting for marriage... so kind of a ""Book of Job"" situation.) Circumcision itself was commanded in the Old Testament.

I'm not sure if I can keep living like this. But I don't ultimately want to kill myself. I just wish I could fix what was done to me. And I feel powerless that anything will change soon.

I heard there's rumors that some form of VERY EXPENSIVE full restoration will be possibly open to the public in a decade or two. But I have no clue how old I will be by them. And research in the area is underfunded, disorganized, and not taken seriously. 

Even worse? Any further reductions in circumcision rates may ironically reduce the motivation of companies to produce a product like that... So a cure/full for the general public may never arrive in the foreseeable future.

I don't even have anyone to be angry at. The doctors? My parents? Society? There's no real clear answer that. And society only really talks about circumcision in the form of a quick gag or joke. So I'm wondering how much sexual pleasure I'm actually missing.

I'd still be mad if the surgery was mainly a non-consensual cosmetic operation on my genitals. But I started becoming overwhelmingly angry at the world, my parents, etc. when there's disputed reports that it significantly decreases sexual pleasure in males. I wonder if that's why sex, porn, and masturbation seems so boring to me. I barely feel anything while watching it.

I've considered moving to a place where assisted suicide is legal. But I don't really have the guts to go through with it. And I'm more afraid of the afterlife presently (June 2020) than hopeful.

Any help? Because it's destroyed my sexual life, hope for the future, and present happiness. And I've undergone a deconstruction of faith.

Is there any hope that it could be fully restored within my lifetime? Or is my sex organs essentially destroyed for the rest of my life? Because if they are... I don't know what I have left.

I never consented to having my natural lubrication destroyed. I never consented to having my sensitivity reduced by an unknown amount. I never consented to any of this. And I can't even express my feelings to anyone.

It feels like I've been horribly violated. 

Since I would have never, ever removed a part of my genitalia for a cosmetic reason. But that's apparently what legally happened to me... since they wanted me to look like my father as well. I barely feel anything while masturbating, too. And I suspect sex is little different.

If I miss the most pleasurable human activity... with someone I love. What's the point of going on? I'm so, so angry at what was done to me. It's like a gross disfigurement and no one in my family understands what they did to me.

I have no friends, either. And was always bullied as a kid. I wish I could escape to sex to make up for it... but I don't want to become a drug user, either. (I've never had any up to this point) But it's apparently the only thing that'll feel really good for me.

A part of my genitals was removed without my consent. And I'm so, so enraged about it. Why even live? How is this okay in the modern United States? Who gave them the right to do that to me?

I'm forced to look at the hideous mutilation of my body for the foreseeable future. And I can barely feel anything sexually.

I'm just too much of a coward to go through with it... I've been thinking to move to a place where it is legal. But I've been so scared of the afterlife. My prayers have been silent so far.

I need some way to cope. I don't want to die. But my parents have been the only ones to really care about me my entire life. And now I feel like they sexually hurt me as a child. But I can't tell them that. I won't tell them that. I don't want to break their hearts. I know that the doctor recommended it to them. And I know that they didn't have enough information to question his recommendations.

But I would give up so, so much to have this not happen to me. My sexuality has been destroyed. I'm so enraged at this world. How is this normal? I wish I had a normal penis.",suicide

344982,"It's a good thing I'm a virgin, because deep down inside I'm a misogynist and monster.Fair warning... this may very triggering for some people.

God, where do I begin... ok so first of all I've never been intimate with a girl. It's because I have 0 sexual appeal, no matter how much I try to ""improve"" like everyone on Reddit advises and how much I workout, etc. doesn't matter one flying fucking bit. Girls don't wanna come near me. You're not gonna believe me because of my psychotic writing below, but I promise I come across as perfectly normal. People love me... just not sexually. I'm a sexual failure.

But the most fucked up part... it's good for society that it's this way. If I ever got into a relationship with a girl, I'd be an abusive asshole.

- I get off on thoughts of humiliating women sexually and making them do things they don't wanna do. It's fucking sick but I can't help it. Let me clear up any confusion from you readers: what's hot is the idea of forcing myself on an **genuinely** unwilling participant. Role-playing wouldn't work because I'd know at the back of my mind that it's a role-play and she really loves it. The idea of consensual pleasure is an instant boner killer.

- If I were to ever get into a relationship with a girl I would only accept it if she were a virgin. I had a quasi-sort-of online relationship with a girl I never met for about 4 months and it fell apart because I was always bitter and resentful towards her for having done heavy petting / sexual stuff with guys before me. What a fucking joke. We never had the chance to meet and I was still jealous. And my feelings have not changed since then, I still can't bear the thought of being with a girl whose loved and touched another man.

- I've taken creepshots of girls, particularly to satisfy my fetish (I'm too ashamed to reveal what it is here). After taking the pictures I feel guilty but I save some of them anyway for later.

After a lot of self-reflection I realized I have basically an obsession with sexual power and aggressive dominance more than the actual aspect of pleasure and fun. So it's a truly scary thought that one day maybe my sexual appeal will attract some girl... and I'll mentally destroy her with all this shit that festers inside of me.

So maybe my crushing loneliness and imminent suicide is actually God's way of saving some poor girl from a terrible fate down the road. I'm actually thinking about doing it tonight, I got an easy painless method and everything. Guess I just wanted to admit my sins to somebody, so maybe God will forgive me after knowing that I told somebody and didn't just keep it inside of me.

but at the same time I'm so fucking lonely and I want someone to care about me even though I clearly don't deserve it.

344988,"Autism makes me feel completely aloneI have autism, so it's very difficult for me to adapt to change and also understand other people. My family keeps getting mad at me because of it, as if it's my fucking fault.

I only have one friend that I completely trust, and it's so difficult to make new ones. I keep hearing about how people have known each other since like first grade, and I met my one friend in sixth. It makes me think, ""Am I just a shitty person?""

So with that, there's only one person on this entire planet who I trust with personal information, but I still can't bring myself to tell him that I'm struggling. I'm scared that he won't like me anymore and then I'll be completely on my own.

I try to spend most of my time playing video games or watching TV, because- unlike people- those are things I can actually understand. But anytime I'm not, I think about how I just want to end everything.

If I kill myself, what the fuck would the downside be? One person misses me for a month? If I get to stop all of this pain and struggling instantly and at no cost, isn't it fucking worth it? It's gotten to the point where I can't feel happiness anymore. I haven't been happy in years, excluding some very rare and short 30-second moments. If I'm able to put an end to this, then what is the downside?

There's literally nothing for me to lose. Sure, I sort of enjoy wasting time and playing video games, but I would gladly get rid of that if it means I can, you know, stop being in so much pain.

The worst part is I can't really trust my parents with this info. If they get mad at me because I have autism, imagine what they would do if they found out I wanted to kill myself. Probably call me selfish and make me feel even worse.

It feels like it shouldn't be true, but looking at it logically... I have everything to gain and almost nothing to lose by killing myself.

So one of my friends pops up hentaihaven, streams it, and we all hop in the stream while he explains the plot and what happening and why he likes this specific series. 


So here comes the problem


My door doesn't lock. So I have to close it and pray to god that no one walks in while enjoying my time with the boys watching hentai, I am sad to announce that god was most likely asleep. 


So we were all watching and my mom barged in to give me some tea, of course me being the smart little bastard I am had a plan set for this exact moment. I have 2 monitors so I set one monitor playing some random YouTube video to distract with flashy colors and another on discord where the stream was popped out and hidden in a small corner but where I could still watch and enjoy the plot. My mouse was also on the x button of the popped out tab and ready to close.


So my mom walks in and gives me the tea, at this point my plan is fucking ruined. The YouTube video autoplayed and no longer is a colorful happy little video and is some guy just sitting there talking about god knows what. So I immediatly close the window and what I didn't fucking realise is that when you close a popped out stream on discord; the stream keeps fucking playing.


So there I am with hot tea in my hand and some hentai sex scene playing on my main monitor. Naturally in this situation on would close discord too, so that's exactly what I did I tried to close discord but my hand fumbled around and made the stream fucking FULLSCREEN on a 16:9 monitor :))).

345077,"Been thinking of it a lot lately.It comes in bits and flashes. I picture myself dying before I realize what I've just thought up. Sometimes I go along with it and I make a mental checklist of all the things I'd have to do. What I would say specifically to the people I'd leave notes for. The note I'd make warning whoever might stumble in to find me, to warn them about what they're going to see and just to call the police or whoever the fuck. 

I don't think I can do it, but it gets more and more real every time the thought invades me. I can almost feel the relief of nothingness and that's what scares me. I'm so tired of being sad. I feel like I'm getting so weak and I'm tired of fighting. I work out regularly, I have a decent enough job, I stopped using drugs and have been clean for years, I have people that love and care for me. I go from being the happiest I've ever felt to feeling a cold needle press through my heart and my brain and suddenly I'm not smiling and all I have is hurt pressing the mute on all of the good things. All of the reasons to continue fighting - and make no mistake, it is a fight. 

I've wanted to kill myself since I was a teenager. I still have scars on my arms, but thankfully you have to look closer than most people get to see them. I'm scared of anyone knowing how scared I am or have been. It feels like my brain takes any ounce of good and twists it until it's sharp and it's found some flaw. I even know that it's doing that, but it changes and evolves. It's always looking for the weak point and I have to defend myself all the time. It hurts so fucking much. I can't even know what's real or just my head making some feeling or paranoia up. My anxiety is turning from sadness and just being a shell of a person, unable to react to stimuli, to angry and overly aggressive. 

I feel sick. The medication hospitalized me last time and I don't want to go back to that. That was somehow worse than this. I'm trying to carve a path forward, but I don't have hardly anything left. I'm so scared of telling people I feel this way, I don't want to go back to the hospital. I don't want them to mistrust me with my own life again. I don't want to die, but at the same time a part of me wants me to die so fucking badly.

345105,"Please read thisHey everyone,

Im a guy in my early 20' and am seriously considering killing myself.

My long time friends are moving on with life. They have relationships and are becoming established. I have had 1 unsuccessful long term relationship and multiple hookups. I'm fucking tired of hookups and don't know how someone can emotionally dull themselves to constantly do it. 

Every week is the same monotonous shit. Working 6 days a week 1 day off and usually spent alone. Sometimes both jobs blend and I wind up working 12 days straight. When not spent alone, it's with coworkers who connect better because they have more time off. I substitute teach so they frequently go out and drink or stay out late on weeknights (we work in a restaurant). No interaction with girls outside of work, who are either in relationships or just want to fuck around. Tired of getting nowhere in my personal life or career (but mostly my personal life). I don't drink much anymore because it was becoming a problem. I smoke 15 cigarettes a day and have cut down but can't stop because I want to fucking kill myself every time I wake up. I'll often wake up crying wishing I didn't have to face the day. No matter how hard I work, certifications and degrees I get, jokes I make (I've been told everyone thinks I'm hilarious and just so personable HAHAHAHA) or plans I make, I go to bed every night alone and wake up with no plans or a single text/call throughout the day asking to spend time with me (or someone I know I can call and spend time with). The worst part about this is that everyone I socialize with cheers when I enter the room and even has a nickname for me. They laugh at everything I say. But they hangout together constantly and I never get invited unless I basically force myself into it. 

I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist. I'm on lamictal for mood swing and possible bi polar disorder. Things are better than before but I still feel empty. Every. Fucking. Day. 

I'm going to drive to a gun expo next month where I can walk out with a firearm and I'm going to drain my account and go on a road trip. My favorite hobby is traveling. I'm going to go everywhere in the United States I have ever wanted to go. When it comes time to come back,  I'm Gna blow my fucking head off. ",suicide

______________________________________________
I don't ever say things like ""kill myself"" or ""end my life,"" or even ""end everything."" Those are first and foremost too explicit for my taste and secondly I view suicide as leaving life rather than ending or taking it. It just makes the pill easier to swallow.

Six months ago my ex-boyfriend attempted suicide. I won't describe how, but I'll just say that there would have definitely been a lot of collateral damage and his attempt boiled down to sheer personal terrorism. He's been stalking me ever since. The point is he talked a lot about killing himself in the aforementioned explicit sense, and I want my death to be different.

I study music at the collegiate level and I'm in my third year. I'm starting to question my decisions and money might keep me from pursuing a second degree. My original plan was to study through graduate school and teach music at the college level, but my passion is dying, if not already dead.

At this point, I can only see myself living an unfulfilling life in a line of work that I hate with no way out. I've already tried to leave everything once but it didn't work (obviously). Since then I've reworked my plan and I'm trying to set a date.

Decided to keep going instead of renting a hotel room with the last few dollars i had and hanging myself there. Figured it would be easier on my family if i did it away from home. Got the job but had to turn it down because I have no money to get to work. Last night i got called too hard to handle by my SO. This morning we got into a petty argument but what he said last night is still running through my mind. This morning I got told to go to hell by my mother.

That would normally be good, but now my old suicidal thoughts have been replaced with thoughts of self-harm. Whenever I do anything that makes anyone else mad, or hurt's someone's feelings I dig my nails into my arm and tell myself that I'm just a piece of shit I am. I say that I deserve to be hurt, and I shouldn't be happy. 

The other day, I broke a razor trying to get the blades out, but it didn't work. Then I shaved with it. I had cuts and scrapes all over my legs, and I just kept telling myself I deserved it. 

I want to tell my husband about these thoughts, but I can't. He gets upset about my depression, because he doesn't understand it. He always tells me how glad he is that I don't cut because he had to deal with too many girls that did that. And now here I am, slowly destroying myself, because I can't stand to be happy.

345173,"Dear /r/SuicideWatch, I just spent the worst night ever. How do people cope with shit like this?**Last night:**


So I've just started a PhD, and last night I went out with a few colleagues, I didn't really know them yet. At some point, this girl I've been sleeping with for two weeks (we've talked online a lot every day for like a month beforehand), tells me she's in the city, so I tell her to come. We didn't really go out together apparently, but according to her we were sex-friends in an exclusive way (not sleeping with other people), or something. Because that's what she wanted. I didn't want to explain that to my coworkers, so I just told them we went out together, and told her so, and that she couldn't flirt, she was okay with that. When she arrives, some other PhD student who's been there for like 2 years starts flirting with her like crazy, talking to her about everything, trying to oppose me about everything and making it look like they agree about something and not me, even touching her arm etc., and she plays his game. When I say something she even goes against me and defends him. So I told her we should leave, we did, we had an argument, I went back home, and she went back to see that guy. WTF?

I talked with one of the guy from the party afterwards, he was dumbstruck, told me he had never seen such a thing, that the guy was a total asshole etc. I perfectly knew this wasn't the most trustful girl in the world (and I'm not used to that, I've always had very long relationships), but I mean seriously? How can someone be so slutty? And have no respect whatsoever for someone you've talked with all the time for one month and a half and spent several nights with?

The real issue here is not the girl, I don't really give a shit about her, it's how to deal with the guy. I'll have to work with him, our lab only has small teams, and seriously, I have no idea how to react. I'm even thinking about giving up my PhD. What should I do?

**Quick context:**


I'm 26, I've been depressed as fuck for at least 8 years (for several reasons), to the point that it made me lose a lot of friends, that I gave up on my studies 2 years ago after a breakup and ended up spending 8 months locked up at my place last year. Before that, even though I was depressed as fuck and I think I pissed a lot of people off, I still managed to study well (I had 2 bachelor's degrees and an engineer's degree, always very good grades), and I had several long term relationships. Since I had graduated in engineering because I gave up on research due to my depression (this is a bit complicated, but I won't explain how the French system works), and since I really felt like I screwed my life up, I started a research Master's degree last year. I ended up being ranked first, got a scholarship for a PhD, everything I wanted. I also had a girl for 6 months until two months ago we had an argument and she left telling me I was crazy, which completely destroyed me. That's probably why I ended up with this other girl. :(

So, wtf, of all the rather long-term relationships I've had before (4 years, 2 years, 8 months), I've never had to cope with shit like that, what the hell is going on? I'm really trying my best to try to live on, but it's getting harder every time.

345183,"I just don't know what to do...Since I have never posted here I guess I'll start off from the beginning. I am a 19 year old male who has PTSD. My PTSD has been treatment resistant so far and I have been getting treatment for about a year now. I was officially diagnosed when I was 18, but I have been having flashbacks since I was 15.

My therapist said this is the last legal treatment she can perform. If this doesn't work I'm down to three options. 1) Go the illegal route with her and buy the purest MDMA I can find and go to therapy and try it with that (I'm not sure about all the details about this so I don't know what would happen). 2) Move away to get away from everything that reminds me of that past event. 3) Suicide.

I don't mind trying the MDMA treatment, but it is an amphetamine, and amphetamines (granted MDMA isn't in the same class of amphetamines) played a huge role in my PTSD and I'm not sure how I will react if it comes down to that. If I puss out, then I will either have to live on with the constant nightmares and flashbacks that affect my daily life. If I don't puss out and it still doesn't work then I am left with moving away or suicide. That is the difficult part. I moved away from one area once where it all happened and now I am having to move again and I am so fucking tired. I find myself constantly thinking about slitting my throat or what would be the least messy way to go out if it comes down to it.

But I‚Äôve been weirdly suicidal and am just wondering what this is, is it dangerous, and should I go talk to someone about this specifically? 

So usually when I start thinking about suicide it‚Äôs like...an infatuation. It‚Äôs all I think about, I research the hell out of the way I want to attempt, I isolate myself, i start smoking pot constantly because it‚Äôs the only thing the helps with the panics attacks, I skip class, I self harm to try and stop the thoughts of killing myself, it‚Äôs a whole thing... 

But recently it‚Äôs been different. I‚Äôm doing a lot better but sometimes I just get a strong impulse to kill myself with something in the environment at the time. 

For example:

I was working out at my gym last night and there‚Äôs a balcony in the gym...and where I was was 20 stories up. Randomly I just had the sudden urge to jump off. And I couldn‚Äôt shake it for like 10 minutes. 

Sometimes when I‚Äôm driving I‚Äôll have the sudden urge just to open my door at 70mph and jump from my truck to the opposite lane of traffic. 

Today I went target shooting with my buddy. I was loading my revolver and had this sudden urge to turn it on myself and blow my head off....and idk why but I never have wanted to die by gunshot. Like the thought of the feeling of your skull getting taken off and feeling that just really discomforts me (I‚Äôm way more of a noose or benzos guy).

I'm 22 yo male from Poland, depressed since I can't remember and social at least since I was 13 yo. First time I tasted a beer when I was around 8, first cigarette at 10, first try with amphetamines and cocaine at the age of 13, when I was 14 I got sexually assaulted by old male stranger and I was too afraid to tell anyone and since I was 16 I keep smoking and whenever I have access to hard drugs I'll do anything to get them and keep myself from sobering. A couple of time i didn't sleep for like a week straight. Since I was 7 or 8 I think till I was 16 I saw my parents every day drunk and I've had to take care for myself, them and animals (we lived on a small farm). It got better only because I told them that if they won't change a soon as I'll be 18 yo I'll move out to another country and forget about them. I have only 1 sister 3 years older than me who used to be a very good sister to me but when she became a teen she just forgot about me. She becase rebel and I've had to be the ""Good child"" who's always there, always helpful, happy, well mannered etc. I didn't really have a friend till I was 16 and changed school and before that I was bullied by everyone, everyday and I've had nobody to help me out. When I found my first friend at 16 yo I was sure - I'm gay and I have to hide it from everyone. I just became more depressed and suicidal because of it.

Its incurable, and presents with symptoms that don't let him lead a normal life (he's no longer able to work, or complete everyday tasks like writing or even eating well). An additional symptom of the disease is depression. On top of that, he suffers from PTSD. 

He's a great guy. He generally has a really good attitude about this, but recently he's become more depressed. He reached out on facebook saying that he's legitimately scared, but doesn't seem ready to talk about it yet. 

Here's the thing- I can say all the right things, but at the end of the day, this isn't going to get better. He knows it, I know it. I've given him strategies (my profession lends itself to his kind of condition) to help with the physical symptoms, but they haven't helped. Hell the guy isn't even allowed to eat his favorite foods anymore because they literally poison him. He's in therapy and has express instructions (which he follows) to go out every night and do something with friends. He does that.

I can't remember everything my dad was saying to me but I snapped and starting saying ""I'm tired of people treating me this way and always talking crap about me it's not right"". Pretty much started crying and breaking down. Then he got up grabbed me by my throat and dragged me and started shaking me while yelling in my face. Everyone was yelling ""stop"" but noone got up to do anything. My sister whose a year younger than me ran up and started hitting his back to get him off me. Then he turned around to face her and I yelled ""Don't touch her"". Then we ran inside to her room and started packing to run away. We also called my mom and she got worried and called the cops. My dad came in the room and all he said was ""Go clean your room"" and had a angry crazy look. Then the cops showed up and I could hear my family laughing outside (like I said in a previous post they are very manipulative and charming). It made my stomach sick. I remember a cop talked to me in my room and saw I had a piano in my room and said it looks like I have a nice life here. This was my grandma's house btw. I told him ""They buy things for you but then treat you badly"". It's true my grandparents spoiled us. I would honestly trade anything materialistic for loving parents.

William Shapespeare didn't have that problem. He may have written the worst play man has ever written, had a few people laugh at it, and promptly burned the script. And now it's lost to time, and he goes down as the writer who never made a mistake. For all the pratical applications of social media, that was the luxury we traded.

Was it worth it? Because now I'm stuck between growing into a better man, who at the height of my success will think ""I was a moron back then! And a vocal one, too! How much could I have changed since then? Maybe I haven't, and everything I enjoy in life is a house of cards."" Or I could spare myself the cringe by never improving, and I don't know which is worse. This is what happens when we're given a megaphone, isn't it?",non-suicide

I got hades, brought mom home and now I feel like I'm finished. That's the thing, if a game actually has a story and I finish it, my brain is just like ""okay I'm done now"" I'm not a person who wants to 100% games other then, Lego games when I was 8 and one exception which is gungeon, but it doesn't feel like I go out of my way to try and earn things in that.

I got dead by daylight and all the dlc, I'm currently not playing it often but I feel like I'll come and go from it.

345237,"Why do I have to be so helpless?I am currently laying in bed thinking about the days events, and days past, my life is a total train wreck, idk if theres any light at the end of the tunnel for me. I grew up constantly raped and beaten, I ended up in a mental hospital in 2016 after my cousin was wrongly accused of being a pedophile(He was the first one to show me not everyone is out to get me and I have learned a lot about life from him and I have grown as a person a lot from when I first met him. And for any wondering people thought he was raping me) and my step grandfather died when I was 13(I grew up with my grandparents from age 6) and my grandmother moved in a random guy because he had money, he told me to kill myself and that he would kill me if I didn't do it myself, it caused me to run away and to the only person I knew, my cousin. At the same time my grandma started playing the sympathy card and sicing random dude on me and the verbal abuse was like a red hot knife to my well being(he raped me twice) and luckily he died in 2018 but my grandma had convinced all of her kids that I was worthless and abused her which caused all my aunts and uncles to treat me horribly as well. A restraining order was put onto my cousin without warning and our sparse 5 minute check in visits went completely away which crushed me horribly and I was alone. I have been locked in a filthy house most of my life, my grandma is a severe hoarder and has 10 cats, there is mold in the walls, cat pee everywhere, cat poop everywhere, and she spends her days sleeping usually from 2am to 3pm and is up blaring music and screaming at me how much of a pig I am and how worthless I am and how I should be lucky she took me in, I'm constantly called names and being called lazy and fat. I did a short stretch with a different family and things began to look up for me, but they were very strict and I was used for slave labor and scolded for every little misstep I took including a B on my report card. I have since moved back into my grandmas house completely involuntarily, she basically kidnapped me, I'm only happy I can see my cousin more often than twice a year for 10 or 15 minutes. I was lured back because I knew I would be back into a living hell but being able to see the only person who builds me up instead of tearing me down was worth it for me at the time. I've gained 30lbs since I have moved back which is surprising as I am locked in a filthy house and only allowed to eat a small meal once a day sometimes I go 2 days without eating. Whenever I have food I gorge on it until it hurts, and always get called a pig, my grandma is a very toxic narcissist, and has taken a liking to insulting my body as well as calling me names and yelling at me for doing anything but laying down and taking the verbal and emotional abuse. She has such bad control issues she has went so far as to pull me out of school, by no means am I stupid I know I could pass school easily, but my depression is so bad that I refuse to do any schoolwork. My out of state family agreed to take me back but my biological mom signed guardianship over and my hopes were so high that I would be going somewhere clean to live. Then at the last minute they told me I cant come back and wouldnt tell me why, I confided in my brother(their son) to tell me, and I found out a pedophile lives there and that's why, I felt so betrayed and angry I snapped at them and have cut off all contact since. I deeply regret it in some ways, but in other ways not. I feel so helpless and I dont know what to do I have nobody to turn to that would help.

345251,"I'm going to be alone forever, aren't I?Three years ago, I would have been attending my first and only semester in college. But at about this time three years ago, my depression would cripple me before destroying me. My grades would plummet into failing. The few friendships I was fostering would be left to die. I would end up withdrawing with over $8,000 in debt.

Upon moving back in with my father, I immediately started searching for work. Any work at all. I applied everywhere within reasonable distance from our house. It would be six months before anybody even called me for an interview, and eight months before I finally landed a part-time, minimum wage job. My university required debt payments after 90 days of non-enrollment, so for five months my father was kind enough to pay $100 a month to keep them from sending a collection agency after me.

So it's been two years since I got that job. I make a little bit more money now, but I still have more than $4,000 in debt. At times I've payed off hundreds more than I needed to, but more and more I find myself caring less and less. I started spending all my extra money on fancy food or video games or booze and just made my minimum $100 monthly payments. The last two years have been like a coma. Absolutely nothing noteworthy has happened. 

And now it's become a cycle. Work, work, work, work, work, then when my days off hit, I crack open a beer with my breakfast and my free time disappears so quickly that I usually can't even remember what I did those days. There is no variation in my life. It's the same week after week after week.

I remember about six months ago I sat down and decided that I would try to meet new people, considering I haven't had a friend since high school. I went out to the mall on my days off (which is more than a two hour bicycle ride each way) to try to socialized. It wasn't so bad at first, but as encounter after encounter, week after week, ended in awkwardness or outright embarrassment, I stopped. I was reminded just how socially inept I am that even high school student had more grace than I did.

And now I just don't care. It'll be more than two years until I'll even be able to think about going back to college. Two more years of bitter loneliness. Now, if I'm not working, I'm shitfaced or on the way there. There was once a glimpse of hope that maybe I'd be able to get my life back on track once my debt was payed off, but now it's gone. I don't care about money or accomplishments anymore. I don't care about being intelligent or educated. I just want some compassion. I just want to not be alone anymore. If I did go back to college, all I'd be is a socially retarded mid-twenties guy who nobody would want to touch with a twenty foot pole.

I just want somebody to show me that they care, but all I've ever gotten is internet hugs and generic feel-good advice. I'm unlovable. I have no personality, no interests, no hobbies, no opinions, no skills, abilities, or talents, no passions, and no goals or aspirations. I am as worthless as I could possibly be. I do not deserve to live. The world would literally be better off without me.",suicide

I was valedictorian and I just graduated undergrad top of my class from another top school, one I never wanted to go to. Have published research papers. Was dating a girl and I helped her write her PhD application to this school as I was writing mine. She gets into every school she applies to because she is a diversity student. So I dump that fucking bitch, she doesn‚Äôt deserve to go there more than me. Tired of this shit. Worked my ass off in undergrad and I was supposed to be rewarded with this.

345255,"Perhaps the Sun will ease the passageI've always felt trapped in my homes, each of them. Safety and comfort reside there, yes, but desolation and the static hum of stillness do also. It's a bleak feeling, walking into the same room, with the same emotions, time and time again, subservient to the oppression of despair. But the sun, and the creation it nourishes replenishes my well-being. My vitality is restored by the peace of nature, and my spirit relaxes in its repose. The organic chemistry that connects me to it, is the elixir of life, it seems, but it's a tonic I drink of far too infrequently, and the artificial repetitions of modern living mute my aspirations for continuing on.

The thought of slipping away, entombed in the same sarcophagus that's enclosed my hopes of a different way of existing, is a cold and putrid thought. The same error that would spill from my veins would only add to the disappointing artifacts of life stored in that tomb. Blank walls and empty shadows would be the same impartial spectators they've always been. Warm blood would meet cold surfaces, and the dissonance would be palpable.

But the sun.. its reassuring rays of light, and the radiation of its passion.. oh, I weep for its beauty. I long for its home, within my heart. To have that source of vibrant vigor settled deep in my soul, to abide in and exude. How terrifying it'd be to die apart from love, away from the communion of love.

345289,"My life is a torture triangle.**Backstory:**

Hi, I'm 15, and I hate my life right now. Some people might think that my reasons are unimportant or that there are worse things that can happen to you in life, but I just want to get it out there. From the start, I was born in Ukraine and lived there for about 4 years, we then moved to Belgium because my dad could make more money there. By the way, my parents had a shitty life in Ukraine (this is important for later). Honestly moving there wasn't so bad, in fact it was the best thing that happened to me. I learned to speak Dutch, made allot of friends, we spent *allot* of time together, life  was great. Things started when I entered middle school, my big friend group fell apart, and my best friend went to a different school, so I was feeling depressed for a little while. We still talked to each other on Discord and things were, *okay.* School hit me like a train, I had to make friends all over again, which was hard to do since people in my class were assholes, also I started failing school, I mean I was an overachiever my whole life and yet here I was with shitty grades, disappointing my parents. The sad part is that all of this happened during Christmas, this was the moment when I started to hate Christmas, not only did I not receive any presents, (I'm not even talking about my birthday), but I got into big fight between me and my parents. It was a really annoying year. Second year felt like it didn't even exist because pretty much nothing happened and I just didn't care, the only thing that I remember is the big Christmas fight that was even worse than last years. Now when third year started (third year = freshman year in Belgium), I thought this was going to be the best year ever, I had great classmates and even some older friends were in my class, things were going great, until they weren't. Introducing...   


**The torture triangle**:  


I make my parents depressed because I have bad grades and because of me being depressed, my dad starts getting stressed which leads to medical problems and that makes my mom depressed, fun fact about my mom: When I was 6, I was sick, ALL OF THE TIME, so that made her paranoid for me becoming sick which turned her into a cleaning torture machine, sometimes I feel like she doesn't even care for me and who I am, my interests, school, all she cares about is if I'm alive and well and that's literally it. Also she doesn't even have a job because she was too lazy and scared to learn Dutch for 10 years, which made my dad so mad that he wanted divorce. She puts hygiene above literally everything and does unnecessary actions which make everything she does 100 times harder or longer than they should be. Also every trip to anywhere goes to shit because we are always late because of her, there wasn't a single time when we had a trip without yelling or anger and us being right on time. Every day there is a fight about the dumbest of things, which makes me depressed and not want to be a part of this family anymore, so I just run of to my room and sit on my computer all day long with my friends, usually, because now I can't anymore thanks to my dad.

Because of my bad grades my dad claims that me being on my computer all day is the source of my bad grades and he's right, but It's also my only source of happiness. So he allows me to spend about 1 hour a day (including my phone) which is just a bombshell for me, I can't make videos anymore, I can't laugh anymore, I can't spend time with my friends anymore,I can't play anymore, I feel lonely. And instead, I have to read 3 books which consist of 500 pages each, IN Ukrainian (a language in which I never read) which is 1500 pages, great. When I read, all I can think about is: my friends are enjoying life together without me and they don't have to worry about the shit that I worry about. Why do I think so much about my friends? I have no siblings, there is nobody I can share my feelings with, because my parents don't care about my feelings, all they want is for me to do work. My friends are the only people in life who I can speak with freely. Not having siblings means I have no motivation for school, because I wouldn't have rivalry to motivate me to be better than them, meaning that all my parents have is me and I'm their only chance, which is a huge burden for me. 

I can't be myself because I have to fulfill my parents' wishes, also I have to listen to how awful their life was back in the day, which makes my problems seem meaningless, which makes me guilty for existing and thinking my problems are problems. The thing is, I can't possibly know how my parents' life was because I could never possibly experience what they have experienced. I have my own problems and my own scale, my parents couldn't possibly understand the things that I'm dealing with. Over time I also realized that I'm more poor than other kids, so I feel very separated from them. Also over the last couple of weeks my friends have been avoiding me at school because I can't socialize online anymore, and it just makes me feel empty and even more lonely. My only motivation in life right now is my friends cheering me up and me spending time on my computer/phone. Please end me..

I would be graduating with a bachelor's degree in English literature, hoping to becoming a teacher someday. I have a family who loves me. I have friends. I do alright in school, I am there for people who need support. 

But what does any of that matter if I hate myself? I absolutely cannot stand to be in this body anymore. I have been struggling with depression anxiety, and I am almost sure, BPD (yea yeah, self diagnosis, but all the symptoms are there, I would basically have to pop into a shrink's office for a diagnosis). I struggle with disordered eating and have 'recovered' when I was in high school; I also struggle with purging, body image and self-worth. 

I was sexually assaulted 2 years ago in a dorm. It has since haunted me every waking day that I am alive. I have received counselling for it and while the ladies were kind and helpful, it still haunts me. 

In addition to all that fun, I am a sex worker because I don't make enough money to support myself. It's alright most of the time, but it has taken it's toll. I feel worthless. My body is repulsive, it's garbage. I want to peel my skin off and die, I am so desperate, and nobody know how desperate I am to die

The pain I feel comes and goes in waves, so for example, I was having a fucking FANTASTIC stretch; showering wasn't a chore, I was doing sort of okay with food and purging, everything was cool. But when it rains, it fucking pours, and each time I fall back into my depression it gets worse and worse and worse... 

I refuse to live the rest of my life going down this path of hell. I am literally taking my life into my own hands. The only thing I am scared of is waking up and having brain damage. Then I really would have fucked up... You know that saying where people don't really want to die, they just want the pain to end? I really want to die. I don't want to live a life pain-free, I just don't want to ""do"" life. I could call a hotline, but what do I say? Those hotlines are there for the people that want to live. I am beyond help. I wish I had a better method. I don't have any hope left; my heart is aching, it is being ripped in two, I don't know what to do anymore... I figure at least I won't be so isolated even if my last words are read on reddit. I just don't want to be in pain anymore, and I am scared; I know it' silly, but I just want someone to hold my hand and let it happen so I know I won't be dying completely alone.

I am a child of 2 alcoholics, a severely depressed mother who never showed any ounce of self love for herself (that lovely trait has been given to me). It's like I'm bred to hate myself. 



I don't want to live because I know for sure that I will never be different. I will forever be depressed and unhappy and I just don't want to go on day after day doing this. People can sense something wrong with me because they always stay away. It's like who I am is toxic. And it is, because I'm not right in the mind. 


Everyday I know I am worthless and meaningless in this huge world. I know I can't make a difference. I know I'm a psychological mess that's good for nothing. No one likes to be around me. I hate being around myself, and I have to live with me 24/7/365. The thought of going on for the rest of my life makes me want to die even more. 


There's nothing I can do. I go to the gym everyday, I am social but since my life is a constant state of nothing and depression and hiding from everyone I lose any friends I make. If they manage to get past the depression I lose them with talk about how much I hate life and myself. Everyone is moving on with their lives, falling in love getting married starting families, starting careers, buying first homes, meeting new people in jobs, moving to new places. They're all so happy and everything seems right with everyone. Why am I this monumental fuck up?

345351,"Inpatient care, good or bad idea?Main point: I've been doing a lot of research into suicide options, they all seem pretty risky and some are just damn expensive. My health insurance will cover mental health inpatient services for a $500 copay. Has anyone admitted themselves into a mental health facility, how did it pan out? I'd rather not waste $500 (borrowed) if it's not going to do much. I don't expect a miracle, AT ALL. But the therapists I have seen are almost embarrassing with the information and advice they provide me. 

Backstory: It's been about 10 years since my depression came on, 5 since it started to get really bad, and 2 years since I've become very serious about suicide. I've seen 6 different therapists (4 of them moved away, 2 of them just did not work at all.) I'm currently trying my 10th antidepressant and I'm just at my wit's end. I live alone, which is a terrible time in itself. I lost my job 2 years ago and I cannot afford to live right now. I've tried for a very long time to find a new living situation, and aside from living in my car, it's just not working. I have 3 pets who I love more than anything in the world, and for the past year I have been trying and failing to work out some medical issues with them. 

Parents, family, friends, co-workers are all very uninterested in helping with support. They say they are here for me but when I need them the most ""something comes up."" I've told them about my fears of suicide and this is still their response. I really would rather not go through with suicide. I have upcoming obligations, I'll soon be becoming the guardian of my brother, and without me, he will be sent away. Even knowing all of this and trying not to be selfish with so many suicidal thoughts, I can't help but think that this condition is never, ever going to go away. I've tried so many things. 

I don't know what to do anymore. It's getting to the point where I'm ready to get it over with at the dumbest things happening because I just kind of cant handle it anymore.

I'm Leonard. I turned 15 yesterday and have been depressed for 7 years, suicidality coming in about a year or 4 ago. I'm not really lacking anything - I'm smart, in a rich family, etc. But I just can't do it.

In 2004, I first went to school. First year of school was nice. Then the second year came. The school and my teachers slowly noticed I wasnt the usual kid - I could already read at that point, while others were still having trouble saying single letters.

The school didn't enjoy that, and I was labelled ""too smart"". I was bullied by both the children and yelled at by the teacher, and got really depressed and angry at everything.

Nonetheless, I went to the third year. There, shit didn't improve either. The teacher was a bitch who yelled at me and I just kept spiraling down.

I believe this was when I first started having "" suicidal thoughts"". Not that I even knew what suicide was back then, I was 6.

I started developing a hobby and passion though - computers. I started making animations and things with PowerPoint, and even got my own Windows 98 computer to fuck around with. Since my teacher didn't know what to do with me, she just let me do shit on the school computer.

The situation got worse and worse and I was taken to another school. This school, over the years, tried to ""help"" me. 

The only thing I learned was to instead of getting mad, I should keep my thoughts inside me.

i did, and it quickly started to overflow. Suicidality came back, I was bullied, also due to having had a muscle disease and not being able to do sports well, I even boldly attempted to climb out the window once. Then, high school came. (We first have 8 years of primary school, then 4-6 of highschool)

I was given a gymnasium advice and went to a gymnasium-only school. Here, I broke.

(Note: Here in the Netherlands we have different highschool (years 12-18) levels, gymnasium being best)

I got bad grades, was bullied, and contemplated suicide again. I had a single friend, who I am still thankful for. Without him, I wouldn't have been here.

Due to my bad grades and mostly my mom becoming a mayor, I had to move. I lost my last friend, only thing I had left was my computer.

I went to another school to do atheneum (one below gymnasium). Grades were horrible, I contemplated suicide, I was bullied, I was hated. Dropped out again.

This year, redoing atheneum 2. My grades are still shit. I can't get myself to do anything. I'm stuck. I kind of have friends now, but its not helping anymore.

At this point, the only thing keeping me from suicide is an anime and wanting to make a program. My parents don't care if I'm happy. They just care about my grades.

And I failed. I just got my results in and I failed.

After my mom subliminally telling me that I'm a failure if I fail, I can't tell them. I don't want to tell them. I just want to die. I don't want to drop farther down. I don't want to continue. All I do all day is fantasise about someone painlessly killing me to then revive me and give me another chance elsewhere. But it's futile. Fantasies can't save humans. I can't be saved. There is no light. Just death.

Here I am, sitting in the bus, thinking why I didn't go to some remote village and jump in front of a train.

Lately I've been In a lot of trouble, My dad found out I smoke weed And he got so mad he almost kicked me out (he actually did it, but the neighbours called the police because I'm 17 and he can't kick me till I'm 18), also I've been lying about doing good in college when I actually failed 5 out of 7 classes (Because I didn't like what I was mayoring in) and he will find out about it maybe tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, I'm pretty sure he's going to kick me out, and I'll probably have to go on to live with my aunts, but I really don't want to, as much as I hate my dad's mega strict rules I really love the lifestyle that he provides for me, I don't have everything that I want but I live good, and If I go on to live with my aunts I'll live on my own probably I'll have to work on a job that only pays me like 500 usd a month, even though here in colombia that's a lot of money for an 18 year old without a degree, I really don't wanna work my whole life in there, also I really don't think I could, because they only hire people to work in there for 1 year and then drop them.

Nothing ever seems to work out for me no matter how positive I try to be. I have always been really uncomfortable and not content with where I am. I am really good at faking it though. From the outside I look really confident and like I have it together. I am completely dead on the inside. 

I graduated from college and started working a job that had a severe impact on my mental health. My bosses were straight up bullying me. I would cry driving to work every single day. I would go home and go straight to bed because being sleep is the closest thing to being dead. I worked there for three years because my parents told me I couldn‚Äôt quit until I found something that paid equal or more. I stayed this miserable for 3 fucking years until finally I had it. 

I decided that I wanted to travel and get away from my home town. I started making plans to go to another country to live and work there. I finally moved in December of last year in hopes that I would finally be happy. I sold my car and all of my belongings and told everyone I wasn‚Äôt ever coming back. This was the trip of a life time and I was so happy to know that it is possible to be happy. This trip ended up being the worst thing I‚Äôve ever been through. I won‚Äôt go into details but the whole trip made me more depressed than I was before. Bad things kept happening that weren‚Äôt happening to anyone else and I become so frustrated I decided to just give up and go home. 

I‚Äôve been home for three months now and I am in shock I ended up back here. I‚Äôm so mad that everyone I traveled with is still in that country having the time of their life while I am back in my home town just as miserable as when I left. I am so sad this didn‚Äôt work out for me. I really thought traveling and experiencing new things would make me happy but if course it didn‚Äôt. 

I have to go back to work which gives me a lot of anxiety. I only have experience in one industry and have sent out close to 200 applications. The only call backs I‚Äôve gotten are from an industry that wrecked my mental health. I tried to stay strong and keep applying for things I was interested in but no luck. I finally had to accept a position in the same industry today and I feel like I want to kill myself before I even start. 

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not trying. I really am. I try to stay positive and think about all the things I got to experience overseas but I just become sad knowing that it didn‚Äôt really make me happy.

My emotionally abusive ex-boyfriend is trying to talk to my friend. I don't know what he'll do to her. I am the reason since he is trying to reach out to me, because I didn't respond to him.
I don't want my friend to get stressed or hurt, she hates his ass.

I figured if I ruin my reputation to him he would stop all of this. I want to say I cheated to him, even if I didn't, or maybe say I kissed another guy while I was drunk. 
That way he would immediately cut me off.

But I am worried about consequences. I might get hit. Also, he probably will gossip all my secrets. He also knows my address. Also, he is in the military right now. What if he misbehaves? I need you guy's advice.

Pros are he would stop the bullshit to me and my friend immediately.

Also, just confronting all the bullshit he said when we were together would make him mad. Admitting I hate him would make him mad, but he will try to talk me out, so saying that I cheated seems to be the best option right now.

345407,"I'm an alien in the new worldNobody cares at all what I think about anything at this point. Anything I like is being stolen and warped into some sort of propaganda piece designed to make me hate myself and make me guilty just by being born the way I was: white, male, straight, and nerdy. Guilty of what I don't know but all I know is that I'm guilty of SOMETHING. That's what I'm told all over the place. Look at what is being told to me from all comers. Thor is being changed into a woman and the director calls me a bigot for not liking the change in the character and wanting to see another character get the limelight long before Jane Foster. I want to see Beta Ray Bill; the character was teased in the most wonderful way in Thor Ragnarok after all. Then the writer for the Black Widow movie admitted that she never cared about superhero movies at all until she saw how much bank the Avengers movies made and realized she could hijack the movies to push her feminist narrative. Characters being race and gender swapped for no reason whatsoever other than to placate the left mob: making Valkyrie in the Thor movies gay, making one of the Eternals deaf and race/gender swapping the rest, and forcing Scarlet Witch into the second Doctor Strange movie.


This shit goes farther than the MCU though. Everything I like is being taken over right before my eyes. 007 is now a black woman. The Ghostbusters were swapped into 4 women. The Oceans series replaced all the characters with women. Star Wars making their main character a painfully obvious Mary Sue that somehow knows how to do everything better than any of the characters from the original movies. She knows how to use the Force with no training, something that not even Luke could do. She could fly the Falcon better than either Han or Chewie despite never even seeing the cockpit of the ship before. She can use a lightsaber without having seeing one of those either. Star Trek has been turned into a harangue against me as well: Discovery's main character is a black woman named Michael. The captain is female as well. In fact there are zero white males to be seen anywhere on the bridge in the show.


Another issue is that people like me, white men, are committing suicide in record numbers as well. Suicide is skyrocketing among young white men in the US. It's not hard to see why if you just look: white males are being ignored by teachers in schools all across the US. Recently there was a kindergarten teacher that only allowed the girls to play with Legos because she had some sort of vendetta against the boys. She thought that the boys spent too much time building shit and if you have women do the building early enough they could go on to the STEM fields because equity is all that matters. Who cares that hundreds or thousands of white males are gonna have to be replaced, they should recognize their white male privilege! Also many women in their 50s that have taken that very route in life have come out and said that their #1 regret was not settling down and having kids. We are teaching our boys that they are expendable. Hell, only men are required to enlist in selective service before they can even vote. We tried making that requirement equal and guess what? Feminists complained that they ""didn't want that kind of equality"". They just wanted to be handed shit that they never earned.


It goes deeper than just being white and male. Being straight is also something I should be ashamed about. In the LGBTQIA+WTFBBQ community they get pissed when the biological truth about there being only 2 genders is uttered. Hell there was a Twitch streamer that was banned from said platform for stating that exact thing. But nudity or breastfeeding? That's A-OK with Twitch! Also look at the ""underground"" movement to get pedophilia recognized as a ""sexual orientation"" rather than a dangerous mental illness. 10 year old kids being forced to dress in drag and dance around while grown men hand out dollar bills like the kid's in some strip club. Trannies demanding that sex ""reassignment"" be included in insurance plans instead of being sent to therapists and getting the help they need. Parents insisting that their 4 year old boy is actually a girl and that the kid came to that decision ""all by themselves"", so they need hormone blockers and estrogen pills to be who they really are. So what if they change their mind later in life and find out that they were made sterile by their parents' eagerness to be seen as ""woke"" over the well-being of the kid? We also have these drag queen story hours as well, where drag queens dress up and read to kids. But what has resulted from that? One drag queen asking kids to grind all over his body and 2 child predators being given access to these kids just cause they dress as women. Asking for a background check is just something a bigot would want! But heaven forfend someone want to celebrate being straight. We have a gay pride parade where kids are being brought and being exposed to men in assless chaps and men kissing men. Want to have a straight pride parade? Nope, celebrating being straight should be shouted down and derided as disgusting. Straight pride = disgusting, assless chaps and being dressed in drag for the sexual entertainment of adults = family friendly!


And that brings me to the last thing that I am being bullied for. I get constantly bullied for being a Republican, and more specifically for liking President Trump. Especially since all the shit that went down this past weekend. People all over the left are using the El Paso shooting to blame Trump and to attack the 2nd Amendment. Calling people a liar who bring up the FACT that Trump asked for unity in the face of hate and white supremacy. That's what happened over at the NYT. Seriously, a preview of the Monday edition of the paper had the headline ""Trump asks for unity in the face of hate"" which is exactly what he did. But the left hates all things Trump so they got onto Twitter and threatened to cancel their membership if the headline wasn't changed. The NYT did change the headline to include the mention of guns, and attacked Trump for not jumping for new gun regulations. My own family still clings to the Russia hacked the election bullshit, despite there being ZERO evidence and in fact there being evidence that it was the Dems who were working with the Russians. Hell the left is bringing up Russia now to attack Tulsi Gabbard as well. If Russia is in fact hacking our election and our polls in favor of Tulsi they're doing a real shit job of it. Before the debates Tulsi was polling at around 1%. Now? Around 2%-3%. Yeah that's some real help for Tulsi right there. And if the Dems weren't hacked by Russia or working with Russia why didn't they allow the FBI to look at their servers during the investigation? What was on there that had to be shielded from the F-B-fucking-I?

Lastly there's the part where I can't get a job to save my life. I've applied everywhere I can think of and everyone just skips over me. They don't even say anything to me they just ignore me. This means that I have zero money to do anything. I haven't left my apartment in a whole week cause I literally have zero $ to my name. Rent and utilities eat up all the money I get from unemployment.

But does anyone even care about anything I just wrote? I doubt it. At this point I doubt it if anyone would care if I killed myself. I would just be another statistic, just another white guy who couldn't stand to see himself as a ever-decreasing part of this country. A guy with no future and no hope.",suicide

Long story short, my girlfriend has lost a childhood friend and an uncle, both to suicide. 
She is still massivley hung up about these and it's something she really struggles to talk about. She's not really a talker where as I am. I talk about how I feel and can almost be overbearing but that's just me.. she's the polar opposite. 

When drunk a couple of weeks ago she broke down and made comments like what's the point in living, it's worthless, there are no reasons to be here she then said the only reason she's still here is because of her dad. This really upset me and we briefly discussed it a day or two after, despite me wanting to discuss it quite deeply. She did open up bless her, she finds it so hard and I  understand that, so I was grateful when she did, she however briefly touched on it and said that it's how she feels only sometimes, but shes fine now, it was just a brief thing... Back to closed and not discussing it. 

Last night I explained that I have been in contact with her dad and I wanted to get her a photograph of her uncle, frame it and have it in her house, so we could remember him and hopefully help her process it, even slightly just by seeing a picture of him. I honestly just wanted to do a good thing, a nice thing and it triggered her so fucking hard, I feel like such a fool, .beating myself up so fucking much.

When I told her it brought it alllll back and she broke down. She's been posting some suicide awareness things to her Instagram story, so suicide is obviously on her mind, I hope because of her uncle just being brought back into the forefront of her mind, not because it's something she's considering.

She's extremely quiet about this topic and says I'll never understand, she loves me deeply and we do discuss literally everything. Suicide is just something we can't talk about. It's absolutely off limits. It triggers her SO badly.

She's quiet, not answering calls and not answering texts. I'm at work and she lives an hour drive away from me. I'm not seeing her untill friday night (at the time of posting it's Thursday afternoon) 

This is the most quiet she's been and most introverted I've ever known her.  How can I create positive dioluges about suicide? How can I respect her desires to not engage in conversation with me but not be anxious? I feel so so so so scared, am I being selfish by worrying about myself? (How will I cope if she does hurt herself) I feel selfish as fuck... But I know she's suffering and grieving so much harder than I am. 

I'm sorry for the vocal splerge, I just really need someone to talk to. 

It might also be worth mentioning that she has tried councilling and it did not work for her. It truly made her situation worse and brought up some demons that she has dealt with and put to sleep. She felt that councilling made her far worse and I know she would never consider that again as an option.",suicide

345447,"Screwed everything up, lost my best friend.First and foremost, at the moment I'm not on the verge of suicide, but Im just depressed and don't know where else to go.

Sorry for the amount of text.

So I'm an Australian 19/m started dating this American girl when we were both 17. We met online on August 1st 2008 and started dating (or at least made our anniversary) September 14th 2008. We first saw each other on December 26th 2009 when I flew out to see her. She flew out to see me in June/July for 13 days in 2010. Then I just flew back for the second time to see her over Christmas and New Years.

I had already bought my ticket for the Christmas/NY trip when we broke up November 1st 2010. (I remember dates quite well)

The trip was fantastic. We fell in love again but knew the distance wouldn't work out when I returned home. We were best friends. She said she felt safe around me and that she could just be herself. I felt the same. For the first time in my life I could just express who I was with her and not hold back. I've never had that many friends, and especially since the start of high school, not many female friends.  I never thought that I could have a relationship like this with anyone let alone a girl. Normally I'm nervous and shy and don't really talk to girls, but with her... damn, with her it was just amazing. No hesitations whatsoever. My life had finally turned around.

Now it's a month and a bit since I've been back and things have never been worse. Anticipating that she'd be feeling down after I left, and especially after we broke up she decided to get a job, and enroll in the maximum amount of University classes she can. She also does Polo which took up last weekend and is taking up the following with tournaments. She trains a few nights a week on top of this for three hours per night.

I on the other hand sit in my room and do nothing. I've just changed Universities as I hated the one I was going to before my trip, to one that was back in my home city. As I've just got back from the trip I haven't been able to have a job during my holidays in Australia. Though I have had an interview last week for one. But now, as I wait for University to begin I sit in my room day in day out, listening to her talk about going to polo, then having homework, then wanting to spend time with friends, then going to work, then going to class.

Furthermore I don't really have any friends. She was my best friend and we would spend a few hours talking every day up until lately. My best male friend is awesome and we get along well but he's pretty much the only person I have now. My next best friend was this girl from high school, who told me last week that she can't hang out with me because she doesn't think it would be appropriate given she has a boyfriend. She also said that she didn't think it'd matter because we weren't that good of friends.

So now I'm down to two friends, her and him. And now that we've broken up and she's coping so god damn well and I'm completely the opposite I need someone to talk to. I try and talk to her but she thinks my problems are stupid and my life is fine. We've been fighting on and off for weeks, which were half my fault, half hers. But I've tried to turn it around. I tried to be extra nice to her lately. I really tried. And I sent her a Valentine's gift, she hasn't received it yet but I really wanted her to enjoy talking to me when she got it. So on Saturday night my time she was going to give us time to talk. Four hours in fact! Four hours! I was ecstatic! I barely ever get one let alone four.... and then skype screwed up... everything screwed up and we got 45 minutes. But who cares, those 45 minutes were great! They were fantastic in fact! But I really needed to talk to her this weekend so she would enjoy talking to me again before she got the gift. So I told her this, I told her how much I wanted us to be good. So the following night, Sunday afternoon, she plans to talk to me for three hours. From 10-1am Saturday her time. But before this she goes out with her friend for dinner at 5pm and then onto a movie at 7pm. Apparently there was a problem with the sound so they only got out of the movie at 10pm and then her friend started talking to her about *her* depression which causes my friend to stay there a few more hours meaning we didn't get to talk that night either.

This made me really annoyed. I really needed this and this was my one chance before she got the present. The one chance to turn it around so that she would enjoy talking to me again and value our time together. I can't get mad at her for talking to her friend when she needs her but if she told her friend at dinner that she was going to talk to me tonight then her friend would have brought it up earlier.

She has this habit of never telling anyone she talks to me. For the last few months of her relationship with me none of her friends knew we were dating.

Whenever one of them comes into her room (she shares a room) she minimises the screen and just says she was watching TV. I get annoyed at her every single time for the past year for this, as I feel like she's not treating me like a person. And she never changes. She never tells anyone that we're friends.

I feel like the unpopular kid at school. You know the one that has no friends, but then one day he finally finds someone. He finally gets a friend! He's so excited but then that friend denies knowing him in front of everyone.

I feel like that kid.

So now things have gone to shit since then. I'm thinking about doing something (re:suicide) but know that I can't just yet. I got mad at her and she retaliated getting pissed at me for expecting so much of her time, when it was just this weekend because she offered and got me excited about it.

She's my only true friend and she doesn't even want to spend time with me. She finds time for everyone in their life except me. That's fair enough at the moment given how our friendship is but it was fine just the other day, and now she's saying that she's too stressed talking to me (when if she just fucking tried to give me the time of day we'd be able to be happy again and I wouldn't be fucking depressed all bloody day) so she doesn't want to be friends anymore.

So now I'm down to one bloody friend. That guy. This guy is awesome and I share everything with him. I share everything with both the guy and the girl but then I find out that she betrayed me about a few things and kept secrets from me for months. And that he lied to me about ever doing drugs for years. This really got under my skin (it was only weed) because I mentioned about how I would like to do it some day but only when it was legal (because it's only a slight urge and I don't really want to risk a fine). So it couldn't have been that he thought I would judge him or anything. In fact I talk about wanting to try LSD for over a year now and constantly talk about how things like this should be legalised.

He won't even tell me his girlfriend's name.

This just really kills me because it reminds me of what the girl did with her friends. Though at least he admits to me he has one.

So I really have no one to talk to. Even if the weed and girlfriend thing didn't bother me about the guy, talking to him about any of this stuff makes him uncomfortable.

I can't talk to my parents because even though they put me up, they don't like spending time with me. I constantly try to sit out and talk to them but they just want to watch TV and get annoyed with me if I try and interrupt it for a board game or something. Because of this I'm not comfortable enough talking to them about it either.

So I have no one. Admittedly I am a bit asocial. I don't like meeting people and that makes this worse. I could quite easily ask some people on my city's reddit to go out and I know they'd say yes, but I just hate talking to people I don't know. I really despise it. I never have anything interesting to say, and whilst I'm good at small talk at the barber's and what not, I can really never develop friendships.

I coach a little kids softball team in my spare time as well, but of course the two people my age that I was friends with there have stopped this year, and the one little girl I practically thought of as my daughter has switched to tennis.

If I had to pick a dream it'd be to become a Formula 1 driver. And I would kill to be able to pursue this (trying to at least) by starting karting this year, but I can't, I just don't have the money. It costs A LOT and I've worked out that maxing my job hours at this place I got the interview for wouldn't be enough (and that's a $23/hr wage - average/high for a student in Australia).

tl;dr So I don't know where I am or where I'm going. My beautiful female friend (who is absolutely gorgeous) wants nothing to do with me. My parents want nothing to do with me. My one friend cares but I can't talk to about anything personal. I hate socialising and am about to start going to a new University. I don't know what to do anymore.",suicide

I never do well in school and procrastinate like hell on homework and studying.

I have a severe addiction to daydreaming that I can't stop. I spend hours and hours on daydreaming.

I can't keep up with house chores.

I even procrastinate on my hobbies by daydreaming or going on the internet. 

I'm extremely worried about my financial security in the future. 

I've had several wallets stolen from me. I have no skills so I'm pretty sure I won't get employed.

I realize that I will never, ever have a normal social life. I was CONSTANTLY rejected by family and everyone I meet in general. Right now I have friends but it's pretty clear that we can't connect to each other anymore because I broke their trust. I feel so guilty for my mom because I'm living off of white lies to please her. I always made major fuck-ups when it came to romance.

If someone is about to break up with you and you know it try asking them to say they hate you.

I‚Äôm aware of all of this, but she sees it as important to remind me constantly of how much I fucked up and how fucked I am. She also saw it necessary to call my interests in theatre a stupid waste of money, so now I‚Äôm too upset to go see a play I had been eexited about. She knows how to destroy the joy in everything.

I feel completely worthless after talking to her and I can remove her from my life or distance myself from her. If she wasn‚Äôt around, my life would be so much easier.

I flew down to see my closest friends for the holidays and I thought everything was well until the last 2 days I was here. I was staying with my Best Friend (who shall remain nameless) and his girlfriend for the week I was here. Over the time I've known them I unfortunately caught feelings for his girlfriend. I never told either of them about my feelings towards her and I wanted to keep it that way. Now what happened was he had to work for the last 2 days I was in and it was just her and I which neither of us minded but she told me he felt uncomfortable leaving me with her alone. I never acted out or said anything about it. After that I explained everything to both of them and since then things were just quiet. It was awkward and silent after it all. I am at the airport now and I sent them both entire paragraphs of how shitty I feel and I can't afford to lose the two closest people in my life. I never got a reply from either of them.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if I want to or not, I told myself that I would wait until after my dad died. No parent should bury their child, so I waited. He died last year but blood still pulses through my veins. My daughter deserves to have a father, she shouldn‚Äôt suffer because of my inadequacy.

I feel so sad. I feel like if I killed myself I might finally get attention and validation through my death. The only meaning of life that makes sense to me in this moment is having sex with as many people as possible. I feel lonely and crave validation so I don't feel like crap. It is as if I need a constant chorus of sincere praise. I've been to psychologists, social workers, but they do not know what the hell they are doing when it comes to issues of sexuality. They have no fucking clue how to deal with losers like me who have never even been kissed. They have no fucking training in it. I feel like there is something wrong with me. I feel like my mother does not accept me for who I am. I am very very envious of people who have had sex, who have always had abundance with the opposite sex, who talks as if it is no big deal when they CLEARLY ALWAYS TOOK IT FOR GRANTED. I hate it when people are open and brag about their sexuality. I don't know what to do. Maybe I'll kill myself someday. Maybe then people will believe that virginity is something that can cause depression. Maybe then people wouldn't invalidate my experiences ""Oh, sex is not everything,"" etc etc. Maybe I would finally, in death, get the validation that I crave.

345492,"Spiderman PS4 Silver Lining DLC Review This is the last spiderman DLC, the game as a whole was great from start to finish, could I say *amazing*. The story has this amazing moment where all 3 DLC stories connect, and it also continues one of my favorite parts so far which is the Yuri Watanabe story. I just was disappointed by how inactive the side story, as it was just ""ok here's everywhere you go to find the story and you have to find a little package there to listen to the story. 

The main full DLC story was amazing and the final part where you fight hammerhead again was wonderful especially with that epic part where the lazer goes all like *psheeeew* and spiderman is trying to hold hammerhead still.

The side content was also alright, I personally didnt like the change in sensory with the hammerhead hideouts, but they added those fancy lights so it's fine, like I can imagine them thinking now the place looks amazing with these perfect lights up. Screwball was alright, there were just en oi uhh missions for me to not want to break the controller, except in the final chase where she has those stupid fricking drones.

All in of it together was an amazing playthrough of this dlc. 5.5/7

Now the full game + DLC. The game was a great way to show what great movement is like, and it should set an example for games to come. But IGN was wrong I didn't feel like spiderman at all 6/7",non-suicide

345582,"Trying to survive.Background info: I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts/ideation since I was very young, around 11/12 years old. I started therapy when I was 15 and have been going on and off ever since. I was hospitalized for 5 days when I was 18 and ended up back in the ER a couple months later. I currently have a diagnosis of Persistent Depressive Disorder with reoccurring major depressive episodes, and PTSD. I'm 27 now, considered very high functioning (working part time and going to school full time). I've changed my meds several times over the years, most recently adjusted them last summer. 

With the persistent depression, my ""normal"" involves experiencing suicidal ideation maybe a few times a month. Usually these ideas are vague; ""I wish I was dead"" or ""it would be better if I were dead"" or ""I deserve to die"". 

But my mood has been going downhill for months. And as of the past week or so, these thoughts have become much more frequent, intrusive and defined. Daily, without an obvious trigger, I imagine myself implementing means and dying. I imagine what it would feel like. It's not a fantasy because it brings me no comfort; quite the opposite, its terrifying and makes me feel physically sick. 

I have an individual therapy session scheduled two weeks from now (it was the first available). I've confided in a few people close to me that I'm having suicidal thoughts, though not in this much detail. I'm trying to stay on top of my meds. I'm doing everything I know to do, but everything hurts and I feel like I'm losing control. 

I don't want to go to a hospital again. The last time they just dosed me up with sedatives the entire week, I barely remember it though the benzo fog they had me in. I also don't want to get kicked out of school or let go from my job for being high risk. 

I just don't know what to do anymore.",suicide
345583,"My life is so fucking dumbI am 18 years old and I'm still in Grade 12 in high school. I hate school so much I have no friends and I hate socializing so I dropped out last year and went back this year. I suck in school so much I always failed every class and I wasn't even in any smart classes. So basically one year of my life gone playing video games.

Now I'm in Grade 12 this year and I'm in one Grade 11 class and one Grade 10 class. I have enough credits to graduate this year but I have no future. I'm not smart enough. I tried to take the most basic of math classes because I always fail my math class. I was/am so depressed that I tried to commit suicide by swallowing 30 pieces of acetaminophen because my parents wouldn't stop fucking yelling at me last year. My parents still don't take my seriously. I STILL think every day of ending my life and what's the best way to end it without any pain. 

I don't feel like getting a job because I am so fucking useless and I hate my parents with a passion. When I was younger all they did was physically and mentally hurt me but now they stopped since I'm older.

All I do is cry myself to sleep at night because I am worth nothing in the real world. Can you believe it? An 18 year old crying. I have no credentials, no experience and all I do is play LoL to remove myself from this shitty life.    

I am a fucking pussy and I went to a therapist to fix my social anxiety problem but stopped going after three weeks because he'd tell me to go talk to people which is the fucking reason I am a social reject.

So what do I do now? I'm not taking nor have I taken any meds but I still feel like suiciding.",suicide

Except its not been that straightforward. For the last 5 years (I'm 19 now) I've had suicidal thoughts, at first thinking they would go away, when they've become progressively worse.

I was a mute towards the later end of secondary school and in college (or high school), being separate from people, silent, made, and still makes me, feel better. I worked throughout, getting only average grades, but the work keeps me stable as to keep my mind off of other things. Due to this I never had much of a social life, and in turn never having a love life.

Fast forward a few years, I get into uni, I'm not really excited, more anxious. The first week I spend as I normally would, away from people, away from all the fun that usually happens in the first week. A group of girls, which I now hang around with, I guess felt sorry for me and talked to me, and I guess from then I've burdened them with me.

One girl, I love to death (excuse the pun in this sense). She's taller than me by about a foot, maybe slightly less, but I would be lucky to ever go out with her. Recently, as a joke, she posted on Facebook that we were engaged when we were working together, and has since blown out of control. I'm too anxious to say anything, but its obvious that it should never happen, due to some reactions she gives.

I've tried reaching out before, to a friend that then said 'oh if you need just call'. I believe the part of me wanting to get help is also dying, slowly wanting less help. I'm arguing with myself to try with my uni friends maybe Wednesday, and that may be my last attempt.

At this current moment I'm writing my final letter, to my family, my 'friends' and whoever else I can think of adding. Apologising for everything I've put them through. One of my grandparents died last year on the 9th February, I never felt like I was really that close, but since it has become clear he was a wise man. As much as it's my first death, it's weird, other than initial shock, nothing. No feelings at all. I'm shamed that for such a loving, kind man that I can't even feel anything.

I plan to finish it Saturday, on the 9th. I can't bear it anymore. I write this in a clear mind. I feel like I should have some feeling, or if I ever did write this that I would be in a crazed mood. Whereas, my mind is clear, I'm calm. I don't fear it anymore.

My family have decided to go out for a meal on the Saturday, in his memory. I'm going to decline and go to his grave. Say what should have been said a long time ago.

I‚Äôve been off my meds because I‚Äôve been so scatterbrained and it‚Äôs really having an affect on me, and I‚Äôm sick to my stomach from all the self destructive eating and anxiety I‚Äôm experiencing.

I called in sick at work today.  I didn‚Äôt realize it was the second time I‚Äôve called in on a Monday, I‚Äôm still in my 90 days and my boss is PISSED.

He texted me back after I let him know I wouldn‚Äôt be in. ‚ÄúAre you kidding me sick again on a Monday we need to have a serious conversation tomorrow.‚Äù

I texted back that I understood, he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you do let‚Äôs just chat tomorrow.‚Äù


I feel like I‚Äôm weak for having called in.  I‚Äôm weak for not coping better with my family or work pressures.  If I lose this job it won‚Äôt be the first I‚Äôve lost due to loss of motivation from constant stress outside of work.  

Everyone around me is tired of hearing my excuses for not going to work because they think I just am lazy.  They don‚Äôt know how I don‚Äôt sleep or how my anxiety has controlled my life. 

I‚Äôm tired of fighting myself, fighting my family, and fighting every day.  They think I‚Äôm weak.  They think I‚Äôm pathetic and they‚Äôre right.  If I can‚Äôt handle the mundane day-to-day how can I handle the rest of my life?

I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to make another bad choice which may ultimately be a good one, whether I down my pills or cut myself, I can never hold up the image that I‚Äôm a fully functioning person for long.

It's mostly because I feel extremely lonely and can't seem to fix it, more on that later.

To remove any doubt that I'm serious in case any of that came across badly, on February 14th, I intend to kill myself with a rope and while listening to a particular song. 

I don't enjoy anything anymore, nothing. All the films I used to love, the music I enjoyed, my favourite food, alcohol or a nice coffee. None of it makes me happy anymore, I'm just numb all the time. Therapy and meds only made it worse.

It's all because of how extremely lonely I am. I get an enormous amount of pressure from my parents (who are fucking awful human beings if I'm honest) to find a girlfriend. I keep disappointing them and keep facing the consequences (my educational or career success isn't enough since I'm missing that thing that'd make me perfect enough for them). 

Before I start drowning in unsolicited dating advice, yes I've tried everything you're about to suggest to me. I tried adopting countless personas now,  meeting girls in god knows how many ways, societies, dating apps, mutual friends. Everything.

I'm a defective human being. While I succeeded in some areas, I failed in some more crucial ones.

345691,"20, maybe 25I just turned 17 and I'm at a very strange point. Like, I cant tell. I feel better than I've been feeling; this year I've reached some of my most lowest and most lovely points, but now I just feel almost suspended. Suspended between everything, not really numb, just kind of unsure I guess. Yesterday I wrote a scattered and half-assed will/suicide note. It doesn't feel as profound as it sounds maybe. Maybe it's just that I don't really want to die, but I sure as hell think about it enough.

So, maybe this'll work. Maybe this will make something *click* in me. Maybe this will end up belonging in r/vent, because I'm going to try wordbarfing into the void.

To begin, I failed my junior year of public school. Summer-schooling would've been a bitch and a half to pay for, and even if I could've paid for it, just the mere thought of doing school a day more drove me to complete breakdown. I fought tooth and nail to convince my parents to let me go into homeschooling (with success), and even now, with an opportunity to work at my own pace, I'm still not caught up. I'm still fucking failing. I've never had huge hopes to go to college but this is just fucking ridiculous. *At least get a fucking diploma*, ykno?

No. Probably not.

I go weeks, months sometimes, without even being able to *look* at my school laptop. Now it just comes down to when my school decides I'm far-gone enough to boot me out.

So, okay! Not too faithful about me succeeding in the academic slice of life. So therefore, no likely job, right? How the fuck am I going to manage that, hmm? I don't know. Art or writing doesn't seem like it'll give you much of a boost unless you're some prodigy. 

*Just wing it*, has been the most useful and most damaging motto, and I will keep on fucking using it.

I also cut off some friends. Three close ones, plus some that kinda weren't. When I failed junior year, the following summer ate at me. I isolated myself big-time after a bit, though I guess it was more just me waiting for someone to reach out. No one did. Like even the littlest, smallest, most minuscule movement to just tip a care in my direction would have helped. I wouldn't have blamed so much on myself, and I wouldn't have dug myself into such a rut. Everyone was *busy.* Guess it's the new trend to hang out with your boyfriend every hour of every fucking day, huh. Guess it's normal to not just *make time* for a friend? Oh! I know, if I've got some weed maybe you'll consider it?

I loved my friends, you know. I was a go-to for advice, a go-to for support. I enjoyed it. Kinda wonder if I was just being used, but I also know there was *something* there at one point.

But I have one friend still. She's family, she's my lifeline. She's more than what a lot of people could ask for, and I love her more than I love myself. I'm starting to panic, though. I included her in my will. I wrote my goodbyes and farewells. Wanting to die is such a mess. If I live, I'll bog her down. I don't see shit getting better for me. I don't see me even working to make it better. I see me turning into a leech once I find out I can't keep a job, and I don't want her to know me in that way. And when I die, she'll despise me. It'll bog her down. But she's the strongest woman I've ever known.

I gave myself a due-date of 20, maybe 25 if there's a flare of potential. But if I can't get my act together before then, I guess it's another test that I'll be more than willing to flunk.

I've been helping my dad, too. We almost constantly butt heads, and I have a permanently iffy relationship with him, but he's sick. Cancer-sick. And my mom works a lot to keep us all going. She's strong too, but she doesn't seem to admire me as much as I admire her.

And it makes sense. I really don't think about them enough. My meltdowns, my panic attacks, my worthless fits. They're both stressed enough. They're trying to convince me to go into the Marines. *No,* please. It's never been for me. College? No, sorry. A part-time job? I *tried,* no one called me back! Do just *some* school? No, I'm tired, I'm sick,Idontfeelgood,Ijustwokeup,maybelater,I'vegotplansI'mpreoccupiedI'vegototherthingstodoI'msorry.

No. I'm really, really sorry.

All the fucking excuses, and whining, and all the sheer laziness and lack of motivation to do anything just *fuels* this toxic mindset I have. *Not everyone can be a hero*, is a particularly favorite excuse of mine. It's laced with just enough dramatics. It sits super well. A good excuse to not try, a good reason to become a piece of garbage. 

I just haven't been able to seem to care about anything. Like, I *do*, I'm able to love and feel shit. Everything just has this film over it, and even with these newly prescribed glasses of mine I can't seem to really see any *worth.* Why is it worthwhile to stay? As long as I'm here, there's not really a reason. I wish I could just not exist in all this physical world stuff. I want to watch my friend and family grow and get better but I can't do that if I'm going to be the whining, squealing little rat that everyone trips over. 

Squeak squeak no longer, r a t.

I don't know what that analogy means, don't question it.

So the only thing that I'm willing to do for myself right now is to just give me time. There might be a revelation, ykno? Maybe I'll mature a bit and discover some motivation to fucking *live.* Maybe I'll decide to finally not lie to my doctor, but I have to find the courage first. The whole idea of anti-depressants has always scared me. I don't want to feel numb. I'd rather feel the things I do rather than feel reliant? I don't know. Maybe that's not how it works or maybe I'll just have to accept that change. Maybe I won't do any of it, and not change, and just make a big ol time-leap to my deadline. Just wingin' it.

Jesus this is awful. Fuck. Haha I'm really tired. Dunno if I should post this because it's basically a garbage fire, and there's heckin' flaws and the worst attempts at jokes, so if you scoffed, I get it. I'm young, pretty fuckin' dumb and naive, and generally awful. Whoever reads this probably thinks I've got some mental tapeworms or something. You're probably uh correct.

I hate myself so much. I hate all of the things that I‚Äôve let happen to myself. I hate how much it affects me. I don‚Äôt want to be myself. I‚Äôve never wanted that. But I think this is the first time that I genuinely don‚Äôt even want to be alive, anymore. 

I tried to kill myself in middle school, but I fucked it up. And I realized that I wanted to really try. I told myself for years that all I needed to do was wait until I was older and independent and had control of my life. But I don‚Äôt have control of anything. I still hate myself, I still don‚Äôt want to wake up in the morning. I don‚Äôt want to die, I don‚Äôt think. I just don‚Äôt want to exist anymore. 

And before I was afraid but I think now I‚Äôm even more scared of continuing. There‚Äôs nothing here for me. I feel like a life insurance policy that‚Äôs about to expire. That‚Äôs my only value, and it‚Äôs about to run out. My mom is sick, she could use it. I don‚Äôt have anything I‚Äôm working toward anymore, anyway. Any excuse I had before seems so trivial now. I won‚Äôt care when I‚Äôm dead. I don‚Äôt even care now. 

Nothing is better. Nothing will ever be better. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault but mine. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm compatible with any of this. And that‚Äôs my fault, too. That‚Äôs where the weight falls off of my shoulders, I think. Just admitting that I did this to myself. That no one else can help me out of it, no one else can fix it. Just me, and I already know that I can‚Äôt.

Anyway. Just wanted to thank you guys, I guess. You really tried to help me, you‚Äôre all wonderful. And I‚Äôm grateful for all of the time that anyone ever put toward me. I‚Äôm sorry it went to waste. Better luck to you.",suicide

Things have actually been really good for me for about seven months when I hadn't been able to string together more than three or four in any given year for the past twenty or so.

I'm trying to figure out how to deal with the fact that I'm stuck doing things I don't want to do anymore...I just don't know what to do period.

When I did see Y everyday we would normally just mess around and do random things or just talk. We were really close and I think if I would of stayed there I probably would of made a move already. But I moved and she made a effort to try and stay in contact with me but I was stupid and let that lapse and we went probably close see to 4/5 years with 0 contact. I recently went back and visited some old friends including her and her family, me, my step sis and Y probably talked in her room for a couple hours before she had to go to work. We had breakfast with her and she was turned and had her feet over on my chair and was kinda turned toward me (yes I one I'm probs reading into this a shot ton more than I should). And we went to lunch later with her mom and my fam and we sta next to each other and made a couple jokes between each other. The next day we went to my step mom's bosses house and I didn't want to do what they were doing so I separated myself and kinda chilled by myself for a couple hours, and I cried thinking about how much I miss her and how idk when I'll see her again and I realized when I cried when I moved 6 years ago it partly because of that same reason. (I like never cry, I had 3 dogs get out down and my parents divorce and sister leave for the navy and I don't think I she's one year because that's how I was raised. But she seems to always make me cry when I leave her and idk when I'm gonna see her again.) It's been close to 3 months since I saw her and I can't seem to get her out of my head I keep thinking about her, and the other day I was looking at her snap story and she was posting some hot selfies and my stomach dropped. I did try to message her but I low-key suck at answering and looking at my phone so between that and the 2/3 hr time difference the messaging didn't last that long.

Anyways, I am a high school student who is relatively smart, but have a very low amount of motivation. This is a shitty combination, because people have high expectations for me that I am not able to live up to. My mom wants me to be successful, and has very high expectations for me, and to meet these standards I have been lying to her for the past few years of my life. Most of these lies are about my grades. At first I was fine with this, but lately I have been doing really poorly in school, and need someone to talk to. I would talk to my mom, but feel like death would be an easier solution than confessing to all of these lies.

To be honest, I've been considering suicide since I was in 6th grade. The only thing stopping me is my mom. She actually admitted to me a while ago that she would kill herself if I did. She is dependent on me (which is why she pushes me when it comes to my success), and I feel like it is unfair that she had me, and yet she is my responsibility.

For almost two years now I've been at the point where I'm trying to hide myself from those feelings. It gets so difficult trying to keep in sight reasons to keep going.

Also, there's alot of generalisation in my post. I do realise that nothing applies 100%. It's the vast majority I'm speaking of.

Seeing humanity for what it is, among other things, got me where I am now. I don't mean to start an anti-society rant since that's not what this sub is for, it's just very important to me. It hurts so much realising how much all bad things that happen are fueled by greed. For the rich people's sake to just keep getting richer, the 99% are treated like a nuisance. The social structures that uphold sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, and just about anything that denies anyone that's ever so slightly off ""normality"" as ""should be ridiculed"" are being fought today, but so long as profits matter, true progress seems just impossible.

People's feelings aren't respected. Your average privileged human being is selfish, ignorant, incapable of caring about those that aren't close to them, and doesn't accept anything that doesn't fit their safe little bubble that they can live in so comfortably. When someone kills themselves, people say ""their demons got the better of them"". While tunnel vision is a factor, I feel it's unfair to use this to invalidate all those thoughts that are truly justified. Hell, it seems to be the norm to make fun of triggers like they're just some kind of self-loathing.

Anyway, back to my feelings. My whole life I've been bullied and scolded for crying. So much so that as much as I can tell I'm supposed to start crying, more often than not it doesn't happen. My throat starts hurting and I panic, trying to push it out, but it's impossible. I've talked about this with my therapist, but they merely acknowledged it with ""well we can see why that is how it is"" but it's never really addressed. The patriarchy and my social environment have broken me and I'm afraid it's beyond fixing.

To exist in this society, it's pretty much mandatory to live on jobs. Since several weeks I've come to the conclusion that I am a trans woman. I'm going to tell my therapist, but I'm almost certain he's going to dismiss it (he's in his 60s). This, combined with my severe lack of social skills and mental stability make it seem impossible for me to ever secure some sort of career to be able to survive on my own. There's no real attention for giving introverts a place in this society (once again, minorities are seen as broken).

I want to live. I want to be happy. I want to make others happy. I want to stop worrying about what everyone thinks of me, every step I take. I want to see options to change this society that doesn't care about anyone. The terrible state of society is often what makes people miserable in the first place.

I need people around me that understand things the way I see them. I've found them online, but I need them REALLY around me. Only then will I be able to not see myself as a mistake.

You recovered, and you failed your first attempt in 2015. You had been a habitual cutter, until your mom found out and exposed you to your sisters. You stopped for a while, but then just kept doing it anyway and hid it. Its been years, and you still dont wear anything unless it has sleeves. 

The ache. The way your teeth grit and hurt when you feel that way again. When your mind starts to believe that it is the only way to feel normal again. That releasing, that sweet pain, and looking down and seeing your true self. It is better than any drug you've had, and at this point you've had them all. The ache of your chest when you sit at your desk with your school work and your pens and your computer and your assignments and your email and your papers and your undeniably painful life. 

It pulls you in and gives you love when you cannot speak to anyone else, but youre not allowed to indulge. You promised. You promised that friend. Your mother. Your aunt. Your girlfriend. You promised... But its the smell of baking cookies, the feeling of fresh sheets, the taste of pistachio ice cream in your tongue, the sound of an orchestra. It makes your teeth ache, because you want it so bad. 

Seeing yourself and looking in the mirror is nothing but pain, and yet pain is the only thing that seems to make the thoughts go away. Doing anything anymore makes your feel inevitably alone. You are surrounded by people who only care about you on the most surface level. No one treats you the way that you treat them, with sunflowers and folded napkins and bows made with white lace. Not expensive, but beautiful all the same. 

If you could only lay down and not get back up. If life could stop for as long as you needed to get things together. If your mind could quiet the waters and your bones rest and let your teeth. stop. aching. If only for a moment you could wait and people wouldn't forget you. If only for a moment you didnt have to worry about food or what you looked like. To sit on your patio that is falling off your apartment building and look at a sun burnt sky like staying here was worth it or affordable. If you could sit and do what you pleased for just a moment, and everyone else would pause, the world would pause. 

You cry and you sit in the bathroom typing up everything youve ever felt on a phone with a broken screen. Your dreams are fading and your eyes are still open. You put down a knife or a pen or a piece of paper or a blade or a pencil sharpener and you sit and you know you won't do it. You can feel the feeling of doing it and its never enough...

I've all but cut off contact with her, Deleted her number from my phone, removed as a friend on facebook. I also knew her FB password, and I knew I couldn't resist logging in to her account every once in a while, so I typed a string of random letters and numbers and changed her password to that... Yeah, now she can't get into her facebook, but fuck her.

That feels fine and all, it's just... I'm left with this feeling of ""What the fuck do I do now?"". Honestly, all I want to do now is sleep... That's it. I go to work, come home, dick around on the internet, then sleep... as long as I can...

I can't stand getting up out of bed anymore. I will hit snooze repeatedly until I have about 5 minutes to get ready for work... Then I fall asleep at work, while I'm driving, sitting in an office. It doesn't matter how much sleep I get the night before, all I can think about all day is how I can't wait to get home and just sleep.

I feel like I'm living in a fog, nothing feels ""Real"" anymore... I don't know how to describe it. I can be carrying on a conversation perfectly fine with someone, but it never feels right, like I'm dreaming the entire thing.

I look at an object in the distance, and my first thought is ""that's not real, none of this is real."" even though I know it is. It is a physical thing i can grab, feel, smell... but it's like it just doesn't click any more.

I don't know how to describe it.

It's like a constant numbness, except I still feel pain, and hurt... I always want to cry, but never can. I just... I want to feel something other than pain again.

I'm so used to having someone there. Someone I can talk to. I miss loving someone, and having that love returned by someone that doesn't *have* to love me.

I just don't know what to do any more. I've thought about suicide my entire life, I was always afraid of the physical pain it would cause me before I died. but the past week, when the shit hit the fan, I don't care anymore, I want to do it, I want to hang myself. I don't care how much it might hurt any more. I just want to be gone

Hahahha the is the funniest advice, I could ""talk about it"" until I'm blue in the face, at the end of the day, it won't change anything. I still think about killing myself every day. It seems like I need to come to terms with the fact that I will never be happy.

My family is really tired of trying to help. I don't blame them. For the last couple of years I have just told them that I am doing fine, and the medication is working and that I am ""cured"". 

Ive pretty much lost control of my life. I have no friends and that's not an exaggeration. I can't remember the last time I talked so someone. I just sleep all day. Today I slept 14 hours. I had a doctor's appointment to refill my medication but I overslept. I arrived 15 minutes late and they wouldn't see me (even though I usually sit in the waiting room for 30 mins anyway). Maybe I'm too cynical but she actually seemed pretty happy about telling me that I missed the appointment. Like somehow getting my medication was a reward and I didn't deserve it. She told me

""It is really important to arrive on time to refill controlled substances. The next opening for an appointment is in a week.'

The doctor told me ""There aren't any withdraw effects from this medication so you should be fine for a few days""

After that I went to drop off an application to apply to my major at my college. I was an hour too late. It was closed. Today was the deadline too hahah.

And now you are probably just thinking that I am being emotional because I had a really bad day, and that's why I am going to kill myself, but you're wrong. I don't feel anything. Maybe I am slightly happy because I might finally get the courage and motivation to finally end my life since I can't take my medication.

It's not normal, right? My dreams were basically crushed. I won't get in my major, I will probably have to drop out next year, and it's all because I couldn't wake up at 2:30 PM. I should feel *something* right? Like angry at myself, or sad. I can't even bring myself to cry. It's pretty scary knowing that I literally can't bring myself to care about anything anymore.

Some are chronically ill with a debilitating painful permanent or terminal illness, or a ruined livelihood with a serious criminal record. We need to stop locking them up in oppressive environments in psych wards with the rest of the violent criminally insane and drug addicts. We need to stop forcing them to take toxic chemicals  that are likely to make their physical illness even worse. We need to stop sending the police after them - If they are already on the cusp of deciding whether to live, then a criminal record and a beatdown on the way to being drugged isnt going to help at all.

I am either about to change my life for good and simply no longer care what people think (an idea that frightens me) or I am going to remain miserable living a life I feel is expected of me because it seems easier in the short term and no one needs to know just how miserable I really am.
I want escape‚Ä¶and the escape is either change my life radically and put up with the scary unknown or take the easy route and just end it all. I don‚Äôt want to end it all most of the time, but it seems easier than the healthy alternative when things get too intense.

What exactly is wrong? I am not sure. In love with a guy who can‚Äôt be in a relationship as he just got out of a LTR and needs to ‚Äòfind himself‚Äô again. I also have feelings for another man who cant do the relationship thing either as it causes him intense anxiety about his own perceived failings and social awkwardness. He likes me but it depressed him to be with me because he does not feel good enough.
I am worthy of something more than both these men can offer, I am worthy of some sort of commitment but the problem is, I see these guys as the only two I am willing to share my true self with.

Idk never thought id be here sharing this on a topic thats very troubling for me to understand rn all ik is that these thoughts of bein free after im dead are more constant as ive been gettin more and more depressed everyday . And everybody im around all think im the happiest person in the world im the type of person that just goofs around all the time make jokes but in reality behind all dat is a broken broken person and im not here for sweet talk from people nun of dat i just wanna understand why i feel like this cause im 100% sure the day i do wake up at 6:15 and im not feeling to great and have those thoughts i will do it idk what to say

345903,"Suicide is my only option at this point.So she lives in a different country, known her for 2 and a half years. Super close for the first two, talking everyday, even quite recently she talked about meeting up and said she loves me ect.

So I finally decide to tell her. It's something I've never spoken about and found it very hard, so I spend about two hours on it, and I was thinking about it non stop for an entire day so she's not busy. Finally get it off my chest and finally trust someone enough to tell. And she responds with ""wow your story is crazy interesting, legit""
 I said ""interesting....um, okay?""

And then she ghosted me. Reason behind losing my social life, developing mental health issues, becoming a loser, and suicide attempts. And she says ""wow that's crazy interesting"" and ghosts me.

If I didn't have a good enough reason to kill myself already I certainly do now. Two years thinking about what would happen if I told her and if I would feel better, and what she might say. Couldn't say it in therapy. That was honestly my last chance to try and start moving on or feeling better. I have nobody else and invested two and a half years into only her, and she's the only person I've trusted enough.

Is there a shittier thing you could possibly do to someone..? Seriously? And I'll still message her until I finally do it. Obviously at this point I have no dignity left at all. 

I really can't believe that was the response....it seems to bad to be real. Can't even relax at home because my dad wants me to kill myself and I have so many health issues from neglect I'll probably die soon anyway.

If she can be that bad then there's nobody who's real. Not for someone like me anyway. I'll be taking the biggest dose I've ever had tonight and see what happens if and when I wake up.",suicide

it feels like being terminally ill and knowing you'll die. i know it's my decision and my choice but at the same time i just feel like it's how things have to be. the knowledge that i will die soon is always looming over my head. it hurts but at the same time i know i'm done fighting. maybe it's tragic. i'm just not sure.

Is life worth the effort put into sustaining it? Especially when your mind refuses to cooperate? Seriously, I can't even think straight at this point. The only thing that eases the situation is being asleep.

I don't have a lot of friends and the only friends I have are primary school friends who I barely see. my last 2 years I got bullied really badly and that made my feel like nothing is inside me. I changed classes now but it didn't get better because it is hard for me to find friends. in my primary school I also got bullied 2 times but then I still had my friends who supported me all the way. I never found someone who really understands me. I asked my parents about my problems and they talked about it but they didn't see it as a big problem. I tried everything to just have friends on school but nothing worked. and that makes my grades go worse as well because i cant concentrate when I try to get friends. 

just something to know: THIS IS NOT KARMAWHORING. this is just sharing my problems to reddit.

It was about 5 am and I woke up to use the bathroom but before I got out of my bed I hear faintly the sound of pounding on what I assumed at the time my parents bedroom door. But after that I heard from literally outside my room in the hallway something metal hit the ground, making me nearly piss my fucking pants. I don‚Äôt know what it was it was the first time something like this had happened and my dad said the night before this that he heard ponding on his door too but he thought it was my sister doing it but she denied it. I have no idea what the fuck it was and it hasn‚Äôt happened since then. But it was only two nights ago so maybe I‚Äôm in store for more but I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this.

345932,"Should incels kill themselves?I don't post on incel boards, rant about women or talk about being a virgin irl. I am able to get along with women, they're just not attracted to me. I've posted on Reddit about wanting to kill myself because I'm not good enough for love, relationships or society in general. This resulted in people mocking me and calling me an incel. This is why I identity as an incel, because other people keep telling me I am and I guess the label applies since I am involuntarily celibate.

So I looked up what people say about incels on reddit and it confirmed everything I believed. I'm pretty convinced that I'm a 30 year old virgin because I'm disgusting, unwanted and I'm expected to kill myself. 

This post, where the OP says I'm a subhuman because I'm a virgin, is the 5th most upvoted post of all time on /r/inceltears.

I don't understand all of this. Like I'm given this incel label, get lumped in with maniacs that want rape legalised (among other strange things), I have to just be okay with being lumped in with rapists and child molesters and people will honestly pretend I'm not supposed to kill myself? Like if everyone agrees that being incel makes me literally subhuman then why not commit suicide? 

It hurts like fuck. I'm respectful of people, try to be nice and make an effort to do the right thing when I can. But yet everyone hates me. I'm the worst of the worst because I'm unattractive and women don't like me.

Everyone wants me to kill myself and the discourse around people like myself proves that.

I didn't know where to post this. /r/inceltears disallowed it and /r/braincels is a toxic place where everyone drags each other down.",suicide

One time I found her diary, out of curiosity I went through it without get knowing (I know, im a scumbag) and there was entries of how she feels like an animal, that her days are empty, she has awful nightmares of her family being murdered and that me and her sister are the only ones that understand and that nobody else cares. but she still feels it isn't enough.

Her sister and I also suffer from anxiety and depression but we have the help there if we need it but she pretends she is fine so that people don't believe her when she asks for help and busy pass it of as attention seeking.

Since the beginning, the amount of homework we were assigned easily tripled. I talked with many of my peers, and everyone felt the same way. In May, some students had the chance of joining a zoom conference with the board of directors as they wanted to hear our opinion. I was one of the students in that conference, and I remember almost everyone complained about how much the amount of homework had increased. We were told next semester would be different, as the curriculum would be properly adapted to online learning.

Next semester rolled around and nothing changed. A couple of weeks into the semester, the department of physiology ran a survey to see how we were coping with the pandemic. Everyone I know answered that they felt overwhelmed with work, and that having no free time was making them depressed. Once again, we were told our feedback would be taken into account to improve the situation, but nothing changed.

Someone from my small group of friends already dropped out because he couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. There is probably many more like him that I simply don‚Äôt know about.

For the last year, I have lived the same routine every day. Wake up for classes, exercise, work on various assignments until midnight, and repeat everything the next day.

It was second nature, not that long ago,

on auto-pilot 

Doing what needed to be done

With a fire, burning and raging inside 

A fire that settled for nothing less,

Always chasing perfection 

A constant, fierce, raging, fire

Its fuel, diminishing 

Its ferocity, turned tame

Its luminosity, decreasing 

Its heat, dissipating 

Its flames, dead 

And all that‚Äôs left, 

Are ashes 


A cold, barren, lifeless field

With winds, bringing more chill 

A place where one can get lost in

Hey,

I'm a 26-year-old man who is married to a beautiful wife, has a 21-month-old daughter, and another child on the way. I was the top of my class in a large HS and graduated college in 3.5 years with 2 degrees. After college, I got married immediately (we had been dating since Freshmen in high school). I had a terrible job. Then it progressively got less and less terrible and the pay got better and better. All the while I was working toward becoming an actuary. I studied hard and passed exams (2). I tried to get employed for a solid year with no luck. My wife got pregnant and when the baby came, we didn't want to use daycare so one of us had to stay home. She is a public school teacher and made more money than I did at my job. As I was unable to get my actuarial job, I decided to be a stay-at-home dad and also a grad student to become a teacher myself.

After all of this, I started to drink (never done before in my whole life) at night when everyone else was asleep. Then I started abusing Robitussin. Then I started smoking weed. I've been going to counseling now for almost half a year. In addition, I have been diagnosed with depression and am on medication.

In addition to all of the substance use, I've also been sexting other men, having realized I'm attracted to both men and women. I've almost met up before but never have.

As a result of all of these crazy things, I've had suicidal thoughts ramp up and up and up. I was hospitalized about a month ago for all of them as it was daily that I wondered why I was still alive and didn't want to be anymore. I had gotten reckless with substances and was hoping something bad would happen.

My mood improved after that, but the substance abuse and longing for sex continued (my wife and I haven't in months).

Well, now I'm back to my bad mood. I have had heart palpitations almost constantly for the past 3 weeks or so. My mind bounces all over the place: I want a boyfriend to cuddle me. I wish my wife and I had intimacy. I wish I had never started the drugs. I wish I could live by myself. I wish I could just curl up in a ball forever. I wish I could get a break from all the stresses of school. I wish I could just be high all day. I wish I could OD. I wish I had a gun. I wish I could stop feeling pain. I wish everything could just go back to the way it was for the past 24 years. I wish I could just get my life back in order.

All of this is terribly confusing, terribly frustrating, and terribly tiring. Constantly bouncing back and forth. Repressing urges. Giving in. Feeling guilt. Distancing my family. Wanting to fix my family. Repeating the cycle. Driving the wedge.

Yesterday, I broke one of my last unbroken rules. I researched suicide. I looked at a variety of ways. My current idea is to keep it mess-less and pain-less.

I don't want to leave my family, but I don't want to continue hurting my family. In a way, I've already left and am just dragging out the grieving process. I'm so tired of living and going through the daily motions. I've tired of feeling trapped inside of a million expectations and things to do. Tired of walking from a room where I have to watch my daughter into one where I have to do all the chores then into another where my homework awaits. I just need to stop.

345995,"I've attempted suicide twice; spouse has stopped me twice; How to move onHi Reddit. To give you context, I'm a 27 M recently married to a 34 M. My depression began shortly after I decided to give up my career for my partner. My insecurity became worse after I caught my partner having inappropriate messages with the fianc√© of one of his friends. To make matters worse, I had also cheated on him prior to his offense. I am now going through my transition between careers and I'm lost more than ever. Every other day we are fighting. My partner has been frequently travelling for work recently and staying late at work too. I do not have a support group where I live. All my friends and family are two states away. 

On July 3rd, I made attempt #1 for suicide. We had been out drinking and returned home around midnight. We got into an argument about something (can't recall). I snapped. Every feeling, every emotion - too overwhelming to contain my actions. I opened the balcony door and climbed over the railing. I was half way over when my partner grabbed me and wrestled me back inside. I can still remember how fast my heart was beating and I can still hear his breathing as he held me in his arms. I ended up passing out from exhaustion and had a major hangover the next day. 

Attempt #2 was last night. No alcohol involved this time. My triggering event was realizing that my partner may never understand how I am feeling. All the same feelings above rushed back. I had spoken to him about how I would try next time by cutting my right wrist since I am left hand dominant. I locked myself in our guest bedroom, where I knew the razor knife was. I sat in front of the door to brace it. I contemplated how I would proceed with my plan - lay a towel over the carpet, grab the razor, and cut vertically. Just as I finished out the details of my plan in my head, my partner was able to unlock the door and lift me off the ground. He had stopped me again. 

I am now en route to my Mom's place to hopefully receive support. He is currently on a business trip. I fear being alone now. I have become very unpredictable and unstable with containing my emotions. My partner barely speaks to me now. I can only imagine the shock he is going through as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up feels like it was all a bad dream. Between multiple divorces between both of my birth parents. Seeing both sets constantly fight with each other and their new spouses, I've had bad memories engrained since childhood. I guess the first one I've personally experienced was with my dad and his 2nd spouse. One weekend I was at my mom's house on visitation (my dad has custody of me), everything was normal. She brought me back to my dad's house, only, instead of my dad and stepmom at the door to greet me, it was my dad. I asked where she went. My dad said she left. To the store, I had asked, completely ignorant to the fighting that would happen between the two when I wasn't around. My dad said no, she's not coming back. She took my baby (half-)brother and left. I was only like 7 or 8 at the time, in 3rd grade. I legit cried for 2 hours straight, and broke down around the time of state mandated testing (i had a classmate whom the teacher was her mom, and when she called her mom, I broke down in class). Time went on and I continued strong in school, all A's all the time, through advanced and honors classes, with occasional slip ups when I would lose motivation, remembering the past.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point during high school, my mom and her spouse (whom she cheated on my dad with when I was still 1 year old, but have been together since. Her spouse was like a dad to me when I was over at her place) got into a loud argument that had me, and my half brother and half sister from her side rush into their bedroom. I saw that they started arguing, and my sister had previously told me that they had been arguing a lot lately and she overheard them talking about getting a divorce. I had sorta ignored those claims in disbelief.  Seeing the two of them fighting brought up the memory of the day when my stepmom left, and I immediately just broke down in a crying rage in the middle of the room. The two of them immediately stopped arguing, seeing me, the most calm and best behaved child of the family, suddenly just burst out, threw them off. I don't really remember much more from that.  Eventually, they got the divorce and my mom moved out into an apartment with my brother and sister. I'll get back to this later.

&amp;#x200B;

About half a year to a year after my dad and stepmom broke up, my dad met his current spouse in the same complex his job at the time was located. She had 3 kids of her own, a son with autism about a week and a half younger than me, a daughter only 5 months younger than my sister, and a son only a month younger than my half brother from my dad's side. Growing up was hell, cause she overprotected her kids and highly showed favortism towards them, often with me getting in trouble for things they did. Eventually she mellowed out and saw things for what they were and got them in line and behaving (with my dad's help). Anyways, a while after my mom and her spouse got their divorce, my dad and his current spouse started getting into heated arguments, which resulted in my dad and I moving out and back in TWICE in the span of a year or two. I pretty much at that point was a complete wreck, somehow still managing to keep up grades in school. The two of them eventually came to terms and  everything is fine and stable between them now.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to my mom and siblings in the apartment. Over time the relationship between my mom and sister got pretty bad. My sister had hit her teenage years and was getting pretty rebellious and, with my mom not being exactly mentally stable, it didn't help. We found out the reason she and her spouse had broken up was because she was basically cheating on him with another lady (mind you, at the time, both sides of my family were VERY closed minded about this sort of thing). My mom was constantly going out, leaving my sister and I (when I was there on visitation) basically running the apartment while she was gone. At some point, it was either valentine's day or my sister's birthday, can't remember which and I was on visitation with my mom. My sister locked herself up in her room at our grandparent's place, being in a bad mood about the divorce and other things. My mom was sorta being really naggy at my sister that day and I tried to stand up to her, only to have her snap at me and threaten me. On the way back to her apartment, more of the old bad memories came up and I broke down in the car. My mom pulled over and took us to the park set in the apartment complex to try to talk to us. She sat us all seperately and started talking to each of us in turn. While she was talking to my brother or sister, my crying turned into a focused anger towards my mom, with me coming to the realization that a lot of the sadness that had happened in my life was because of her. I got up and started walking through the complex back to the apartment. My mom saw and came and grabbed me by the shoulder. Now, I've never been the one to fight or cause problems, I was always the quiet one, never really doing anything besides reading or playing video games, so I've never been in a fight. But at that moment, when she grabbed me, I just instinctively twisted her arm and we got into a small fight, nothing crazy, just a grapple fest. I was so pissed. Growing up, I've pretty much always bottled my emotions, mostly cause my dad was the kind of person who thought showing emotion was weak and not a ""manly"" thing to do. But at that point, I couldn't bottle anyting else up, and I just blew my top. At that point, my sister stepped in and seperated us. My brother and mom went back in the car and drove around the complex back to the apartment. My sister and I, on the other hand, walked back in an attempt to calm me down. I was shaking so hard I couldn't even unlock my phone at the time to call my dad and stepdad to let them know what happened. It was saturday, so my dad was at my grandparents place (from his side), having a domino night. My dad was pretty shaken by hearing what my sister and I said on the call, cause after the fact my family over there even noticed my dad was not right. He was about to rush over to my mom's apartment to pick me up, but I told him no, at that point I was just thinking about watching over my siblings.

&amp;#x200B;

Over all these years, probably since high school, I would get into highs and lows, but the lows would always be lower than the last, and and the higher the highs, the harder the crash into the lows. I graduated high school with AB-honor roll (placed 36 out of like 300 gradutates,including AP and dual enrollment students) and got accepted into UCF with the Bright Futures scholarship (covering 80-90%, Pell grand covering the rest, and excess into my new bank account). Throughout all that time though, especially during the lows, I always had the thought of just ending it. Tying a rope, slitting a vein/artery, jumping headfirst off  the roof of the house, never had the guts to do it, which just adds to my self loathing and bitterness. Finished my first semester at college pretty well. The second semester was when issues started. My laptop (which was, at the time 7+ years old) was pretty much dying, and I was doing everyting I can to keep it working (replacing parts, installing Linux cause windows got corrupted, etc). Eventually my dad forced me to get a job, mostly because his spouse kept bitching at him at how I was an adult and not working and just relaxing at home during the weekends. So eventually I got a job at waffle house for Friday-Sunday, to try to get some money to replace my laptop, only one caveat, I had to give about $200 a month to them to help out with bills and groceries (with me keeping maybe like, $100 at the end of the month to myself after food and stuff). I eventually replaced the laptop, but between working and school, my grades slipped just enough (to just 0.01 under the gpa requirement) for financial aid and I got cut off from both Pell and bright futures. At that point I didn't know what to do. I couldnt tell my dad and his spouse, they were basically religious about grades, and I was placed on a pedestal by my family all my life for being so ""smart"" and being the first one to actually go to college and graduate (my dad dropped out, his sibilngs never went to college). Anyways, I couldn't tell them that I lost financial aid. At the same time, at one point, my 2nd stepmom basically guilted me into keeping on working, we were talking in the car about something, and she was saying that basically that I was helping a bunch, but if work was getting too much, that then thats fine but my dad would have to work even harder and do even more overtime to keep up with bills and such. Me, being a people pleaser and the kind of person who can't help resisting ones in need, basically just kept working. I ended up to keep working at waffle house, and eventually went from door choir to waiter to try to earn more money. I ended up taking a student loan to try to keep going to class to try to get my degree. But my grades kept slipping. Especially in math, which used to be one of my best subjects, now I won't go into detail, but for lower level math courses, the university basically has you slave in what could be a prison in which you do nothing but math for 3 hours straight a week as a requirement. I can't do that. With math, I basically flip back and forth between it and other things to keep from being overwhelmed and to keep calm. So I pretty much couldn't focus at all during that time and eventually gave up going at all, even though it was a requirement. I kept working and my grades kept on slipping semester after semester, with lack of sleep and time to try to study and do homework being the main culprits, but I had to keep working to support the household.  Eventually I went on probation because my grades got too low, and flunked out the following semester. No one knows this, not my best friends, my closests friends, and family. This is the first time I've talked about it. I've been going for a year and a half, amost 2 now, pretending to still be going to college, because I'm afraid to tell anyone. I'm afraid, I don't trust anyone. I ended up defaulting on my loans, and have collectors on my ass, again no one knows. I've gotten so good at lying to my parent's face, that they can't even tell I'm lying. They believe I'm currently taking online classes, albeit little by little part time, continuing my studies, but I'm not. Just today and yesterday, I got ad letters in the mail from different attourney offices, both mentioning that apparently my collectors have filed a lawsuit on me. And now I'm at wits end. I don't know what to do now, I don't doubt the letters, I've given up on paying the loans because a good chunk of my money now (about 2/3rds of what I make, currently working at home depot) goes to the house, incuding paying the whole electricity bill and groceries. The last third goes to paying my phone bill and personal needs like food and such.

Earlier this year, I got hit by a car while crossing the crosswalk, walking to work. Ended up with a torn ligament in my shoulder, a lump on my head, and very light damage to the occipital lobe of my brain, even after being tosssed 15+ feet from the collision. My dad was out of town at the time, picking up my 2nd stepmom up from the airport after she dropped her dad off back in her home country. I called him, called out of work, and called 911. Went to the hospital and was given painkillers and  stuff, was told I would be fine with some rest. I ended up making a claim on the guy who hit me's insurance with help from an attourney, and got the treatment I needed. Sometimes, though, especially now, I wish the collision killed me. I wish that I didn't hang on, or that I wasn't so strong willed to live. At the hospital, my mom's side caught wind from my sister, who was told by my manager that I was at the hospital. They all showed up, my dad, on the other hand, told me not to let anyone from his side know. Anyways, I'm sitting in the ER with just some road rash and a lump on my head (from what we could see at the time), surrounded by family. And I started crying. Not because of the pain, because I felt none, not from the shock. But because I felt bad for making them worry about me. I don't deserve their worry. I don't deserve their love. I've been lying to each and every one of their faces for years, and none of them know. I sometimes just want to disappear, just vanish, or just suddenly wake up and be gone from this bad dream. Just now, while writing this, I've been having the though to go to the kitchen, grab a knife, and just end it with a prick, or just grab my bedsheets and tie them off tight. But I know I won't. I'm a coward with ideas and no drive. My drive left me long ago. I just go with the flow and try to cause the least amount of trouble, so when the time comes, no one will miss or notice when my time comes.",suicide

346019,"I know this is SuicideWatch, but I can't post this on AITA and I would still like to know the answer to my Question, AITA for self harm? A bit of backstory here, I have started self harm since I was 10 years old due to depression. My parents do know of this and every time they see that I have new scars they will be quite angry, but some of the reasons that I self harm is also because of they being abusive sometimes, such as once when my mother pushed me off the chair I was sitting and punched and kick me for something very small that I no longer remember. Whenever they get angry and scold me or hit me I would also get emotional as I am still a kid, and I would have to calm myself down fast or I might do something rash and get things worst, so I would self harm secretly as it was quick, silent and easy. I could also distract myself with my phone but most of the thing I was either unable to get it or they will take it away from me.

So the problem starts a few days ago when my father saw that I a lot of new cuts on my leg. I don't really remember the details of why I harmed myself anymore as I try to not think about it too much. His reaction when he saw the scars was to hit my leg at the spot where my scars are. I was just 13 and I was scared of my parents so I didn't really think to protect myself and I just sat there and let him continue punching and kicking my leg where the scars are while scolding me. He also said a lot of things like: No wonder you don't have any friends at school (I really don't) and that I am stupid. He also took my phone away from me and mash it on the ground while saying how the phone was harming me. Some time later, my mother forced me to apologize to my father for self harming. I understand that they might be worried but I think that hitting me especially on my newly formed scars was a bit too much.

The next day in school I went to see my counselor and told her about this, but she stood on my parents side and told me that it was indeed my fault for hurting myself in the first place and things like that. I felt really hurt when I was told that but maybe she might be right?

So, AITA for cutting myself when I was in stress and have no other way of calming myself as my parents won't let me do anything and did I deserve the treatment I got",suicide
346020,"Disappointment after disappointmentIt is the first time i do this but i have to say it because i cannot say it to my family.

I am tired of thinking that things will get better. At first I thought starting university would change everything i would make friends. Of course it did not happen. After finishing the first year I realized that the degree that i was doing (mechanichal engineering) wasnt fullfilling me and i changed to physics. Of course, i again stupidly thought things were going to change, and they havent. I have been thinking about suicide for more than 4 years, I am a 20 year old boy now, but this year has been the worst one. I stopped thinking about suicide as just something that could happen in the far future. This year i have had the worst days i have ever had, really wishing i could die without hurting my family. I wish i didnt have a family that cared for me just to be able to kill myself without hurting them, that is all that is stopping me. I am not interested in my future. My family thinks i am lazy, grumpy and just an antisocial, but i dont want them to know anything of this, i just do not want to do anything.

I cannot convice myself to study and pay attention to the lectures, i just sit in front of the computer waiting the lesson to finish. This makes no sense at all. I just spend the day trying to entertain myself with the ps3 or doing sudokus, because i cannot study. Sometimes i feel more or less normal, where i do things without just thinking to much. That it always comes back with great power and I just want to kill myself. It started again a few days ago and I even wrote a letter to family (which I have never done) because i thought that at night when it was my time to take out the dog, i would hang myself in a tree with my dogs strap. But once in the tree with the note in my pocket i dint jump. I was excited and nervous. The hours before that i was also excited that i was gonna do it an just spent the hours doing sudokus. I think and I feel that i have to die before i turn 21. It makes no sense living like this. I wanna die but something doesnt let me take the final step. I just wish i was stronger to take the decision and just finnish it for ever. Nothing interesting is coming, I dont want to come back to the university and share a flat again with strangers. I dont want to live this again. Even when I think things will be better by doing this or that they dont, so what is the point?

Why doesnt my fucking head work as it should? My family loves me and they do everything for me. We do not have a lot of money but my mum still makes and incredible effort to pay for the flat so I can study Physics. And still i disappoint them this why, i am stupid.

Why when u fall in love, you don't think about the world just this lovely feeling, when u eat your fovourite food, for that couple seconds is just U + Food and nothing else in the world.

Why do u think is that, why psychodelic makes u feel like this, did you ever thought about that, maybe they try to show us something, teach us something.

Why Meditation is so mainstream in nowadays, ,,stop thinking, breath in, breath out"", meditation is made for u to stop thoughts ruuning throught your head 24/7.

Thoughts are #ucking DEMONS! You may even start thinking about smth nice, and couple seconds later u want to slit your wrist.

Everybody want to be richer, more beautiful, more this, more that, to thrive in this RAT RACE called life. Even when u think u doing well, u will find another shit to worry about, most of our thoughts are negative or you just good carrying person and you worry too much about your family and friends, if u want it or no, u just can't win.?

My best times in life were when, i have fun with friends, eat great food, have sex, play game, love, (Times When We Don't Think, But Living) That is why we take drugs, drink alcohol, to stop this never ending war in our heads.

LAst 10 yeras of my life i wa trying to be beautiful, rich, this, that and when i didn't think about that, i was worring about my brother, sister, father, mother..., and something was always bad.

Throught my last 10 years of deep depression, sucidal thoughts, on and off, years of trying everything to be happy to be free, i just gave up, Something broke in me i had enough. And i naturlly stopped thinking, stopped trying, just STOP.

I will tell u something, that is what meditation is trying to teach us, what psychodelics are trying to teach us, JUST BE, JUST LIVE, STOP THESE DEMONS, thinking can make your life living hell, especially in nowodays when everybody are in this RAT RACE. Just try to stop, ignore the voice in your head called EGO (DEMON), at first it can be hard, but when u in this flow state, this beautiful state of not judgeing not reactiing to your ego, U WILL FEEL FREE AS A KID, when we kids we happy we free we don't care, when we do drugs, alcohol the same.

About 3 weeks ago my Dr increased one of my antidepressants and I was genuinely feeling GOOD after a few days. I was motivated, positive, and sleeping well. I was able to force myself to exercise. I joined a gym. I even picked up a new hobby - yoga! I was also eating really healthy. I was able to control my binge eating. I didn't eat anything bad at all the holiday parties I went to. I was proud of myself. I was feeling good about my body. I wore a skirt for Christmas Eve. Things were good. Not ""amazing"" but good. Content.

Then right after Christmas the good feeling went away. I just felt sluggish and blah. But today, today it all came crashing down. I don't know if there was a trigger. I don't know if it has something to do with the fact that I started a new birth control pill 5 days ago. Maybe I'm getting sick after being around a bunch of sick people for Christmas. I don't know. Does it even really matter? I had a taste of what it felt like to feel ""okay"" and now it's gone. I feel like a shell. I'm 28, unmarried, poor, ugly, and aging. I hate the way I look. I'm not overweight but I'm covered in cellulite. I'm pale as fuck, and not in the pretty way. My hair is frizzy and disgusting and my face has wrinkles and is losing it's shape. The women in my family don't age well. I'm not going to be an exception. I'm past my prime. What's the point in continuing on? I have so much shame in the way I look.

I really liked doing yoga. Until I decided to record myself. I can't afford a class, so I wanted to record myself doing the poses to make sure I was doing them correctly. What I saw made me want to vomit. I'm so disgusting. I'll never be a feminine, beautiful, graceful woman. I'll always be awkward and clunky and flabby.

I realize this all sounds superficial. But I think it was seeing my appearance that triggered me. But it's not just my appearance. It's everything about me. I have no friends. No social life. No hobbies. Nothing that makes me interesting or cool. And I don't even care. I don't care enough to make friends. Or a hobby. Nothing sounds good to me. I can't find pleasure anywhere. Nothing feels like it has a point.

ive been having suicidal ideations for a few weeks now but i‚Äôve been depressed since january. nothing specific triggered it that i can think of. i‚Äôm just not interested in continuing to live and i haven‚Äôt been for awhile. only one of my friends knows about this and she‚Äôs 3 hours away by car and i feel bad about putting this on her so i‚Äôve just stopped talking to her about it in hopes that she thinks everything is better. i talked to a crisis counselor via text today and it really didn‚Äôt help me at all. i don‚Äôt really enjoy talking about my feelings in general and i don‚Äôt think i know anyone who would handle the situation in a way that would make me feel better. ive looked into therapy and i called a bunch of places and they weren‚Äôt taking new patients so i‚Äôve kind of given up on that.

i‚Äôm planning on hanging myself because i think that would be the least painful but it means i can‚Äôt be like mobile and i‚Äôd have to find somewhere to do it. my first plan would be my room but i really don‚Äôt want my roommates to be the ones to find me. i was originally looking into the sleeping pill route and i was going to smoke weed and go to a park and give a crisis hotline my location as i was passing out so that EMS personnel would find me, but since no one really wants people to kill themselves it‚Äôs hard to find out how to get them and how many i‚Äôd need to take online, which sucks for me i guess.

i‚Äôm writing a note after this to bring with me wherever i end up doing it. i might still go to a park but i really don‚Äôt want to scar someone forever and i think it‚Äôd be easier to find my body just asleep on the ground vs hanging. i‚Äôm probably not going to do it tonight because i want to clean my room and do laundry so that it‚Äôs easier on my family to pack up my stuff. i‚Äôm scheduled to work tomorrow but i‚Äôm planning on calling off and saying that i have food poisoning. at the moment, i‚Äôm planning on doing it tomorrow night. i just wanted to write this all down as kind of a last ditch effort. i‚Äôd rather exhaust all of my options and i‚Äôm down to the end.",suicide

346066,"I Wrote My Suicide Note TodayToday, I wrote a note for my intended suicide six months from now. I have a debilitating neurological disorder that has made my life miserable. Everyone is complaining about COVID-19 quarantine? I've been socially distancing for years. Haven't worked in two years, haven't exercised in two years, haven't done anything in two years.

I am a shell of a human being. Doctors keep saying, maybe this med, maybe this med, maybe this med, but at this point, I'm just so tired of hoping for the next miracle. There is none. My life is exhausting. Waking up is exhausting. Eating is exhausting. Typing is exhausting. Sitting is exhausting. Standing is exhausting. Sleeping is exhausting. I haven't felt rested in two years.

I'm 26. This illness has stolen my twenties. I want to be a dad. I'm not going to be, I can't put this on children. I want to be a husband. I can't burden someone else with this. I'm a drain on my parents, I've been fighting with social security for two years, and I just want to be independent again. I want to work again. I want to hike again. I want to work out again. I want to be human again. It's just not happening.

I don't want to end my life. But the thing is, I've been dead for years. Killing my body isn't really going to change much.

So I'm giving it six months. Six more months to hope and pray that social security comes through, or that I'm cured, or that something changes. Six months.

346069,"The ache in my chest is so terrible, it just might kill me. 32FI don't actually plan on killing myself, I just need to unload. It hurts so much that I can barely breathe.  

I separated from my former husband back in January 2013. I wasn't about money, so I didn't ask for alikony, I gave him the house, and I only receive $300 in child support. I was fine financially, at the time. I was unhappy so I drank. I was a functioning alcoholic. 

About two and a half years ago I was raped. Without going into too much detail, I realized just how unhappy I was with my life. I had a job that paid well, but I felt I had no purpose. After I was raped, I realized that it was partly my lifestyle that put me in that situation. I have a 10yo daughter, and she needs me. so I turned things around. 

I stopped drinking, I quit the job that made me so unhappy, and I went back to school to finish my studies. I got into a good relationship, and everything seemed alright. It was something I wanted to work out so badly. 

After I quit the lucrative job about two years ago, my dad was diagnosed with cancer. I watched him decline from full function and then I gave him his last dose of morphine three days before Christmas, an hour and a half before he died. 

Cue February, what was supposed to be my two year anniversary, my boyfriend decides to end it. Or he thinks he wants to; we're incompatible. So here I am, 32, facing imminent homelessness and hurting so much that I don't even know where to begin. I'm withdrawing from school so I can find a job, but I haven't had a steady one for about two years now. 

Every day I force myself to go through the motions; pound the pavement to find something--anything to get me back on my feet but I feel myself slipping further and further. I wish I had a measure of certainty, even just a small bit. I no longer have a lot saved because of the deficit in child support, and I also tried to help out my mom financially when my dad was sick. 

Now I have nothing left except for the daughter I love so much, but we all know love isn't practical. It won't put a shelter over her head or feed her. The aching in my chest is so overwhelming I can hardly breathe. I don't know who to turn to, or to ask for help. I have nobody left. ",suicide
346070,"Advice, support, anything for a mom of a 13 year old who wants to dieGod I love this kid.  She is the most amazing thing in the world.  And she wants to die.  Maybe not die, but make the world stop hurting her.  

She is struggling with anxiety beyond measure.  She doesn't want to go to school.  She has hurt herself.  Twice we have had to take her in for a safety check.  She is still not okay.  A good counselor has been found.  

Prozac made it worse.  We are trying something else now.  She is lying to me about it.  I know she texted the hotline yesterday and lied about what is going on and then when I asked her if she is reaching out  she said no.  I think she lies because she doesn't feel like she has a ""reason"" to be this way.  

While I had her phone I texted the hotline and asked what to do on the thread they had.  I told them she is making things up and we agreed better text them than friends and I deleted my interaction so she won't know, I know.  She tells them we yell at her, sold her horse out of spite (um we have a fish, but no horse) that she sits on railroad tracks and jumps off just as a train gets there (the only railroad tracks she can get to are dormant) that we have grounded her..... she told all this to a friend out of town last week and we ended up in a cop car to the hospital.  

But I'm not mad, she is that desperate.  She doesn't know how to do emotion.  3 years ago a foster teen daughter came and the house went from painfully emotionless to chaotic.  In march her cousin killed himself at 18, he was gay and schizophrenic.  I've always had in the back of my mind that my daughter may be gay.  In April we told them we were divorcing and in July, I moved out.  In august she had to run for her life to escape a house fire.  And then my little crowd hating introvert went from an outdoor school of 50 to 7th grade.  

So I get it.  I get the hell out of it.  And I see the bright future ahead of her.  Maybe even 6 month from now.  But how do I help her find it now?  How do I keep her living long enough to push through this?  I'm getting desperate.  I'm scared.  I needed someone to tell this to.  Thank you for listening. ",suicide
346071,"Update.TLDR at the bottom of this post.

I survived the attempt. It's all foggy but I passed out at some point soon after I commented saying that I took the pills, several hours after I took them, and was unconscious for several hours. I woke up covered in bloody vomit but I survived.

Some people have said that I am posting for attention. I understand why you feel that way. I've posted four times in the past month, three of those were in the past three days. But I've just been posting a lot because a lot has been happening and I have nobody in my life that I can talk to. I was posting for support. I understand that support and attention can be perceived as the same, but trust me, I was not posting for attention. If I was, then I would've wrote down every single thing that he did to me, every single thing that he said to me, every single way that he made me feel. I would want everybody to know every single detail so that they would pity me. I would post when I had flashbacks, when I had a nightmare, when I couldn't stop crying. But I didn't. I don't want attention. Honestly, the attention I have been getting is terrible. I've gotten horrible PMs (from u/Roachzilla and others that don't seem to be troll accounts so I won't say the usernames). I don't want attention, of any kind. People have been asking me for nudes, people have been telling me that I'm a slut and a whore, people have been saying that I'm asking for it. And I'm not saying this to make people feel bad for me, for how my posts have been received. I just want to say that I wasn't posting for attention. I just wanted support. I did not post anything after my first post for 20 days because I didn't want to bother anybody, but I've just been extremely suicidal recently and I needed support. Now I'm going to write down some of the details just to show why I couldn't handle it. He pushed my face into the dirt and the snow and raped me vaginally. He pushed me against a tree and raped me vaginally again. He shoved his tongue into my mouth; his hand was on my cheek and he was pressing his body into me in such a way that a tree branch was pressing into my neck and cutting off my air and suffocating me. His thrusting pushed dirt inside of me, and my pee has been brown/black and sprinkled with dirt and blood since it happened. I was breaking down from keeping everything to myself and not telling anybody. The flashbacks have been out of control, the nightmares won't stop, I start crying or have panic attacks at the drop of a hat, sometimes for no reason at all, everything has been triggering flashbacks. I just needed support. I just needed to vent and to get everything off my chest. I just didn't want to be alone. I just needed support. I just needed somebody to not only listen to me, but to hear me, to hear what I'm saying, to hear my concerns. I'm going to keep posting just because getting it off my chest helps me. If you feel that I'm being attention seeking, I won't reply to comments anymore. I'll just make the posts and then that'll be it. Making the posts helps me calm down, it helps me be less suicidal, so I don't want to stop making posts when something happens and I'm feeling suicidal. That's what r/SuicideWatch is for. It's for people to post when they're suicidal.

Also, I understand that it's frustrating that I refused to call the police. I'm sorry. But those of you who have ever been raped or been in an abusive relationship, you'll understand. It's terrifying to think of what might happen to you if you try to break away from them. I'm sorry for not taking your advice and for not calling the police immediately after it happened. I know that it seems so ridiculous and that I seem so stupid for not calling the police. I know that he's going to keep hurting me if I don't report him. I know that logically if I report him, he won't hurt me again. But I can't make myself fully believe that. I keep thinking to myself ""What if he gets released from prison? What if he finds out where I live after getting out? What if he kills me? What if I get kicked out of my family for reporting him? What happens if I age out of foster care and end up on the streets because I can't afford a place to stay or find a place to work?"" The what ifs were what was holding me back. I know I'm being irrational but I am terrified of him. I'm terrified of reporting him. And also, I didn't post for you all to solve my problems. I know that with something like rape, it's up to the victim to solve the problem. The victim is the one who makes the report. The victim is the one who testifies. It's up to the victim. I never expected you to solve my problems. I just needed to get everything out. Even if there was somebody in my life that I could tell, I haven't been able to say out loud ""I was raped."" There's so much stigma around rape. It's the only crime where the victim is blamed. It's the only crime where the victim faces more stigma than the perpetrator. Rape carries so much stigma and I cannot say out loud that I was raped. Typing it, making these posts, helps me get it out. It helps me. I wasn't looking for a solution. I know that I have to report him. It's hard but I'm working on it. I've been looking up the laws in my state. I've been making calls to hospitals and to women's shelters and to rape crisis centers. At some point in the near future, I'm going to the police station. I'll ask about whether or not my parents will have to be told. I'll ask about what protection they could offer me after reporting the rapist. I'll ask about the process, about testifying, about everything. I'm going to get a rape kit done tomorrow if possible, and I'm not sure when I'm going to make a police report but there is no statute of limitations in the state I live in for the class of rape he committed, so I have until I die to make the report. I appreciate the support that I have been given and I appreciate the advice that I have been given. I apologize for taking so long to follow it. I'm just terrified but the support that I've been receiving is helping me take the steps I have to take in order to report him and put my rapist behind bars.

Many of you think that I'm faking this. It's understandable why you think that way. 1 in 6 women are raped, which means that 5 in 6 aren't. Rape isn't something that happens to everybody, and here I am posting four times about being raped. I'm not lying though. If requested, I can send the moderators images of my injuries and they can verify that I was in fact assaulted. I'm not going to post the images for everybody on here to see.

TLDR: I survived my suicide attempt. I'm not posting for attention or for anybody to solve all my problems, I'm posting for support. I've decided to report my rapist.

346099,"A Decade of DepressionThis is my first reddit post, and it‚Äôs almost depressing in itself that it‚Äôs in this subreddit. I‚Äôm a 27-year-old female who was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety in my teens. I‚Äôve been having suicidal ideation since I was about 15.  Around that same age, I started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. In high school, I was psychiatrically hospitalized three times. I‚Äôve had over 7 years of therapy. I‚Äôve analyzed every part of my personality and my childhood at length. I‚Äôve tried nearly every type of psychotropic medication there is. I‚Äôve had psychiatric genetic testing done that confirmed that I am highly resistant to anti-depressants and at a higher risk of weight gain as a side effect of these medications (during my most recent severe major depressive episode, I gained 80 pounds in a year while on meds and have still been unable to lose the weight). I‚Äôve had blood testing that showed my serotonin to be extremely deficient (my levels at the time being 26 ng/mL whereas the National Institutes of health state an average range is 101 to 283 ng/mL). I‚Äôve undergone unilateral electroconvulsive therapy (‚Äúshock‚Äù therapy). 

I have the most loving and supportive fianc√© who I‚Äôve been with for nearly 9 years and a wonderful 10 year-old soon to be step-daughter who I‚Äôve helped raise since she was a baby. And yet, I can‚Äôt seem to escape this pervasive depression and the dark thoughts that accompany it. It ebbs and flows, but it always creeps back in. When I was younger, I hoped that the way I felt was just a temporary response to the awfulness of the teenage experience and the chaos of my home life. Most people assumed it was a state that I‚Äôd outgrow, and when I came off of my medication in my early 20s after 6 years of taking them, I convinced myself that I had grown out of it, as well. I lost 50 pounds, and was in the best shape of my life thus far (a nice change of pace after the weight gain from my anti-depressants in my teens which resulted in teasing and awfulness at school). I was still anxious, but I was functioning better. 

In high school, I transitioned from advanced classes to barely graduating with my class. While all of my friends went on to college, I stayed home and tried to fix my head. It took me years to feel somewhat normal. Around 22, I started taking classes part-time at my local community college. By 24, I had been recruited by the Honors Program with a 3.97 gpa, I was selected as a student representative for a college board, I was elected to student council, I was selected to speak at Honors conferences along the east coast, I was a peer mentor, I was president of a club, I received a full scholarship, and I was applying to Columbia University to study psychology. The semester that I was supposed to graduate with Honors, I had fallen apart mentally and had to leave school because I was so depressed and anxious and suicidal that I couldn‚Äôt function or sleep or concentrate. I was so ashamed and felt like (or should I say feel like) such a failure. 

This was the second time that my depression had completely uprooted my life. I had come to view the first depressive episode as an isolated incident, a period of adversity over which I had triumphed and was now stronger for having experienced. But when it happened again, that changed the narrative that I had created for myself. Twice was a pattern. It could happen again and again. The second I‚Äôm finally starting to feel better and getting my life back in order, it could creep back in and destroy everything all over again. I spent the next year hardly leaving my bed. I took pill after pill and nothing helped. I was even put on a drug cocktail that included lithium by the end and so I had to get regular blood work to check for toxicity. That fall, I started ECT and that helped more than anything ever has, but it‚Äôs also an exhausting process and short-term memory loss is a side effect around the time of treatment. 

That was all about two years ago. I haven‚Äôt felt the same since. It feels like what I imagine being in remission from cancer feels like after being so sick. Every time I even feel the inklings of a normal negative human emotion, I feel like it‚Äôs back. I‚Äôm always on edge, waiting for it to sneak up on me and drag me back down. It feels like my normal mood state is just lower to begin with. I‚Äôm always hovering above depression. In my mind, the analogy most fitting has always been that it feels as though I‚Äôm perpetually treading water, struggling to keep my head from going under. It doesn‚Äôt take much to start drowning. I feel like I have all of this potential but I‚Äôm stuck with a brain that doesn‚Äôt work right and I don‚Äôt know how to reconcile that. I‚Äôve been feeling down again lately and I still haven‚Äôt even fully recovered from my last depressive episode. My suicidal ideation creeps in almost as if they‚Äôre intrusive thoughts. Upsettingly graphic images of my death flash in my mind on a daily basis lately. I try to imagine my fianc√© or his daughter finding my body strewn on the floor or in the bathtub, and the guilt stops me from doing anything to myself. But it feels like it‚Äôs getting more difficult to ignore the thoughts lately. I can hardly sleep. I can‚Äôt help but think that my brain is unfixable and I can‚Äôt fathom a lifetime of feeling like this. Even if it subsides for a while, the fear of it returning is utterly paralyzing. I‚Äôm at a loss. I don‚Äôt expect many people to read this, and I know there‚Äôs nothing anyone can say to make me feel better at this point, but I guess there‚Äôs just something comforting about writing this all down. To everyone else out there who is feeling pain, I‚Äôm sorry for you.",suicide

(Backstory)
I was in an abusive relationship for 3 years, I left 9 months ago. I haven't talked to anybody about it, not even friends, especially not a therapist. I've been generally pretty accepting of my situation, and have been very careful to understand my trauma. I don't want this to ruin my life, I don't want to forever be known as the domestic violence survivor. I've worked hard to fight against the eating disorder, depression and anxiety that have come from the isolation and abuse. 

So I used to get beat for hours, by a 250 pound man sitting on my chest, getting hit repeatedly, spit on, gagged, choked to the point of passing out, you name it. I'd go to take a shower once things chilled out, and would end up getting beat on my way in, or in the shower. He'd grab my hair tight, bang my head into the shower, bang his fist into my head, push me into the tub and tell me he wish I'd just die. That it was so hard to kill an idiotic whore. There was very, very extreme verbal abuse during all of it. 

(Moving onto last night's incident)
My roommates are out of town so I'm home alone.
I work 6 days a week and am exhausted, I almost felt drunk because I was so tired. I messed up my back a couple days ago, and went to take a bath. As I got ready for my bath I started having very intense flashbacks. I felt like I was about to get pushed to the floor and sat on and degraded for hours. I reminded myself that I'm safe and okay, that I don't have to worry about that shit anymore. I started thinking he was right though, that I am a stupid, attention whore, just like every other bimbo. I wanted to smash my head into anything around me, just like he would, and fucking end everything, my family doesn't love me, I don't have anybody. I already knew all of that and he just reassured it. I was in complete shock, I had a massive headache and wanted to smash my head until it went away and hopefully leave me dead in my bathtub, where I wouldn't even be found for days because I have nobody. It was the first time I've actually scared myself that bad, I couldn't see straight and it felt like my body was floating and like I didn't have any control over my limbs. I got out of the tub, got dressed and laid on my bed where there was nothing nearby. I had awful thoughts of finding any blunt object and hitting my head on it until my brains spill out. It was the only time I haven't trusted myself to stay safe.

This morning I missed work, I wasn't trying to suppress that suicidal episode with my god awful customer service job. But I'm doing okay. Learning that I actually do need therapy. I didn't know the trauma was that bad until now. I called a suicide hotline when I woke up, just to feel a little better.

I've never had a flashback/suicidal episode like that. I cannot imagine those of you who deal with that constantly. My heart goes out to you guys.

I highly doubt my SO will ever find this or care I've posted looking for advice, but it makes me feel more safe this way. Let's just say we're both in our late 20's and we live in the United States.)

I think my SO may have manic depression. While I do work in social services and am well educated in this field, I am not a psychiatrist and thus cannot make the professional diagnosis of bi-polar disorder but in the amount of time I've known them, I see those characteristics. It also runs in their family, compounding my conclusion they may have it. 

I only bring this up because they tend to have these episodes of threatening suicide in two scenarios (extreme depression and occasional drinking bouts to the point of blacking out) , but I'm afraid that all this talk of suicide will eventually turn into action. We live together alone and neither of us have a stable, solid support system outside of each other (family living far away, no real close friends). This even makes me depressed, but I would never kill myself over it -- the good news I always come back to is we have each other. 

They, given these moods and also occasional excessive drinking, given also the lack of support system and lack of money and real fun in our lives makes me easy to see, when in a really depressed mood, why suicide seems like a good idea. 

I just don't know what to do and I have no where to turn for help when my SO does these things - I'm afraid to call for psychiatric help for them because we both need to keep our jobs, but again, without close friends or family, I'm left to my own devices.

Hey, guys... I'm Lillie. I've been lurking here for a few years, since I was about 15 or so. I have always been the shy type, so I... never interacted ): I'm very awkward, and bullying in school never really helped me learn how to socially interact... A year ago, I... guess the term could be graduated(?) from here after I turned 20. I know that anybody of any age is allowed to interact and talk, but... well, I'll just shut up about this, and get to the main point of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

Trigger Warnings: Being trans, suicide, severe depression... 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background first... I promise it will make sense afterwards.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I am transgender. Meaning, I am a girl. I have known this my entire life. I kept it secret as best I could, and apparently, I managed to do so flawlessly. Nobody ever expected it when I came out in October of 2015. I was met with a ton of criticism, but I also had a very few teens my age that accepted me. And to them, I will always be grateful.

I would always sit on the side throughout my life, and watch girls do things with other girls, while I was consistently paired with boys. And not good boys at that. From as early as memories are able to be recalled, I knew that I was truly a girl on the inside. I never knew how to tell anybody. How could I when I would constantly have family members indirectly talk about how disgusting I was? Some even talking about how they would kill people like me. All I was able to do was hide.

But eventually, I was unable to hide the fact that I was a female any longer. However, it was too late. I never got to experience a girl's childhood. I would go to school every day with a plan on how I would befriend the other girls in my class. I never succeeded ):

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now... to the actual point of the post... I am so... for a lack of better words... suicidal. It extends to yet another thing that I have hidden about myself, and what the main point of my post is. I only know of one person who is aware of it, and that is my mother. One day, at the age of nine years old, I came to the realization that I would not always be a kid. That I was one day going to turn eighteen, and I was currently halfway to that mark. I began to hyperventilate, and I started screaming in a panic attack. It was one of my largest fears. My mother ran into my room, and began to hold me as I was almost flailing in a state of pure confusion and fear. I have always been one to hide what is wrong with me, but in that moment, I simply told her. I told her how I was so incredibly fearful of growing up. How I detested the very idea. She told me, and I quote, ""you don't ever have to, baby. you can stay as my world forever."" I felt slight relief in that moment. However, I knew that regardless of her words, I would still eventually technically grow up.

Years would go on, and I would have other kids talk about how they dreamed of growing older. I would simply listen in nothing less than confusion. ""Why would anybody want to be a dumb adult?"" The thought petrified me. More time passed, and I began to grow more fearful of the ever approaching eighteenth birthday that I couldn't possibly delay. I didn't just have to go through a male puberty, no, I had to also go through the stages of growing up. That is to say, what was expected of me. But in the end, I would always secretly resist. I could tell that my mother had forgotten all about that night where I told her about my fear and dread of growing up. It was more than apparent that she only said those things because she knew I eventually would stop caring and fearing to grow up, not because she actually felt that she was okay with me staying as a child. I eventually promised myself that if I ever reached my eighteenth birthday, then I would... ): Well, the day surely arrived, and while I tried, it was futile against my other fear of death. Apparently, there are so many people who believe that all suicidal people do not fear death. Well, I can assure all of them that they are sorrily mistaken. Just because I want to die, is no indication that I do not fear the death itself. Regardless, the day did arrive, and while I smiled through the day, there was no present or celebration that could make my heart smile. It was my fear of growing up that had made me loath each and every one of my birthdays. Needless to say, this one was the worst of all. I was practically dead the second the clock struck midnight on the date of February 7th, 2017. No more childhood to spend as a girl or have others accept me as a girl. No more childhood period. It was over. The End. All I could do was cry the entire night.

""Look, at you, finally an adult!""

""No more games, you are in the big world now.""

""My baby is finally all grown up.""

I hated hearing those comments so much, that simply typing them out just now was enough to give me flashbacks to those days. I am unable to sleep, unable to think, unable to process, and unable to live... I... I refuse to be an adult. I won't do it. I can never be made to do it. To be an adult is to sign my own death certificate. I have been found to even have the mind of a child by all of my psychologists. Apparently people are shocked by that due to how properly I prefer to speak online. I have what can be considered as permanent Age Regression. Where my mind stopped developing early on.

I recently came out about all of this on Twitter to quite a few people. I was met with so much hatred, that even my coming out as trans looked like a wonderful time. I was blocked, I was slandered, I was told to never attempt contact with them again, and I was told of how much of a freak that I was. People were accusing me of being a predator because I wanted to remain my mental age. Just because I want to be my mental age, doesn't mean I'm willing to date somebody my mental age. But apparently, people are too stupid to understand. I almost began cutting myself for the very first time. I waited my entire life to come out about wanting to remain a kid, and this was my response... This was how I was being treated. I can't say that I expected differently, but it can not change the heartbreak. A week or so later, I had a therapy call. She told me that I had to find a new psychologist because they only saw kids or people in school. For the very first time in the four years I have seen her, she heard me wail in sadness. For the first time, I didn't care about holding back my tears. She was the only therapist I ever loved. The only therapist that ever understood me. And she was telling me that I had to go. I apparently have another call with her today. But it feels so pointless. If I can't have her, then I will see nobody else. I am in so much pain right now. I am being treated differently by everybody around me because I am an ""adult."" I am sorry, but no, I am not. If I can not remain young, then go ahead and end me. I have no other reason to live. I can't even be a girl. The only thing I see happening as a result of making this post, is all of you giving me the same treatment that I just received on Twitter, but hey, I might as well try to gain approval... I have left so much information out, and that is probably for the better. I am tired of the nightmares of growing up and losing my hair. I am tired of all of this pain. I am tired... of being treated as a male, an adult, and a pervert as an extension. I have the same mind that I did at the physical age of 12-15. The only difference, is the amount of depression, self hatred and fear that has accumulated within my soul as a result of being seen as older, and as a male. I am being treated as an adult more and more every single day.

I just want other people like you all (my mental age) to accept me as who I am... I have severe PTSD from early childhood trauma, and this brings back painful memories to talk about...

I have cried so much while writing this, that I have to be severely dehydrated. But... I just don't care about hiding anymore. Thank you for reading... and I love you all...

346144,"Seriously considering buying a gun in the next few days...I've had some kind of clinical depression since I was about eight or nine years old, with that has been this daily constant low hum of suicidal thoughts and ideations. At this point in my life, I'm just tired of this party and I'm really ready to leave.

I can't stay drunk or high all the time anymore. I don't want to live half of my life in this self-destructive rampage and the other tied to a mattress. I'm just tired of feeling dead and not actually being that way. I love opiates for that reason, for a small amount of time I can actually get what I want, and if I can take enough my heart will stop and I really want to pass that line. 

In March I'm planning a road trip to the west coast. The plan is to go to the southwest and end up in Santa Cruz, hang out with my only friend, drive up the one to Washington. I've been toying with the idea of buying a gun and bringing it with me in case it feels right. Just find some peaceful spot and just check out. Send my buddy some GPS coordinates and a little goodbye and have that be it. 

The only thing that's been keeping me alive for years is this idea that I'm going to miss out on something or that life could eventually get better. It's not getting better. I'm in the prime time of my life and I'm miserable, it wasn't better than my teenage years, and I don't think it's going to change in the coming decades. 

I'm not loved. I'm not happy, let alone joyful. I don't have any family anymore. Nothing works anymore, none of my vices. I just want to find a good view, get high, listen to Pink Floyd and blow my brains out. 

There's not really any reason I'm posting this other than my friend got tired of me texting him about all this shit and wanted me to make a throwaway and just purge this shit. But after typing all of it, it still doesn't help. I'm not happier, I'm not calmer, less angry, more hopeful. Nothing. Its all a fucking waste and I hope eventually all I am is some statistic just like the rest of you. Just a fucking line on a goddamn spreadsheet.

346157,"As my thoughts progress from a passively suicidal undercurrent to active, I'll post hereLike I said in the title, I've been passively suicidal (or ""casually"" as I've seen it described here, or a strong undercurrent). Noticed the past couple days those thoughts got stronger and moved to the front of my mind. 

I guess all this drama shit going on with my therapist, all the damage to the relationship, all the stipulations and bullshit where I cant even be honest with her...its really taken its toll. I saw her wednesday where I told her everything she said and did that hurt me (it's been building for over a year) and was met with excuses, but I have such a delayed emotional reaction nothing really registered until hours later. I'm considering discontinuing therapy with her and theres no way I'm ever going to a therapist again. This ""mandatory reporter"" bullshit and all that is not for me and I cant ever be fucking honest or I'll run the risk of having cops and law being involved and being shoved into a fucking hospital or some shit.

I know my situation isnt nearly as bad as what I've seen others post here, but I've had literally so much with people just fall apart this year. It feels like my whole life has been torn away. Everyone that taught me how to love and trust again is gone, or at least not as closely there. Theres more than just that and theres other issues associated with a lot of other shit (I made a post somewhere recently about it).

It just hurts so fucking bad. And every time I think anything I'll turn all my irritation or anger or whatever emotion I'm feeling onto myself. If I'm hating people more than usual I might as well end myself because I'm actually the nasty problem. Literally everything I'll take out on myself. Anyone that has reached the privilege of being loathed by me (two people in existence), I realised everything I want to do to them I already do to myself. Any strong emotion I'm feeling will be rejected by my body or something, typically in the form of the most painful, stabbing headache straight from the pits of hell I've ever had. It's like a cluster headache on the back/top of my head. Its decidedly not a tension headache, but something that only happens when I'm feeling some strong emotion, positive or negative.

And we (me as a part-time student employee especially), in contrast to dentists definitely do not get paid enough to put up with that gross shit.

Also, your haircut will turn out a lot better if you take care of your hair in general or at least wash it beforehand. What do you expect us to do with an actual tumbleweed on your head? Hairdressers spend a lot of time in training and mostly take their jobs extremely seriously, so if your haircut turns out absolute ass, you‚Äôre either really unlucky or need to take care of it more. 

In conclusion, please wash your hair before going to get it cut and make sure it‚Äôs not too gross. Otherwise you‚Äôll hate the result as much as we do the process, also, if you‚Äôre one of the people that take basic care of their hair, I literally love you to death. Thank you.",non-suicide

Get ready, this is a long text...

When she told me in WhatsApp that she liked me, I asked her to hang out with me the next day. Well, that day is today and I'm back from there. Well, actually some hours after that happened...

We spent two hours walking and talking in a park, she acted very friendly and nicely all the time, just as she was before she said that she liked me, and it was just like two friends hanging out. I didn't have problems talking to her, although it was a bit uncomfortable.

I asked why she liked me, she said I was handsome, which I disagree, but she also told me that I'm special because everyone else is like dumb people.. Its really hard to explain but I understood her, is like whe world is full of entitled popular dudes who think they are superior, and then there is barely any people who are actually a good person. In this case me.

We talked a lot about different things, I also used the advice you guys and gals gave me, I really appreciate it.

Then I walked her home, and that's it.


So, this is a really good opportunity, I mean, I alwas have thought about a girl who would actually ask me out, instead of me having to do it, but, to this day, I never had a crush on someone. And I still don't...

Sadly, she is not the one. It's impressive that we have literally absolutely nothing in common, and when I say nothing I mean nothing, While she makes exercise, I enjoy reddit memes on my bed, while she plays fifa on a ps4, I play Minecraft on PC, while I listen to pop songs in english, she hates music in english and likes to hear reggaeton. Also she is a tiktoker.


Also I have a problem with her way of speaking, it's not her fault at all but it's horrible, let me explain so everyone around the world can understand:
I live in Spain, where we mostly speak spanish, but also inside a community called Catalonia, where we speak Catalan. I never speak catalan, I prefer speaking in spanish, and also I don't like speaking in Catalan since it makes me remember my mom, which left us (I live with my father and see her once every two weeks) And this girl, always speaks in Catalan, which makes me super uncomfortable, I hate it... Her and my mom are the only two people I speak Catalan with.

When messaging her in WhatsApp, she abuses a lot this emoji: ü•∞, (I never use emojis) and my mom uses that emoji a lot too, and they speak in a very similar way, which really disturbs me, I just can't live with it...

I love taking that off my chest, thanks for reading!

They don't know I'm gay. I dated a man ten years older than me for a year. He was funny, intelligent, handsome, and was the one person who could genuinely make me feel alive, like I actually meant something. He was everything I wanted in a person. After a while, he wanted to have a polyamorous relationship with me, him, and his ex, and I gladly went all for it, until he dumped me and just got back together with his ex. Just thinking about them together fills me with an incredible mixture of sadness and jealousy and anger I didn't know existed.

It's been two years since that happened and haven't been with anyone since. And today, I found out a guy who I've been in love with for a long, long time, turns out to hate my guts. I don't think I have ever felt a worse kind of pain in my life.

I want everyone having dark thoughts to read this and realize that they always have the power to improve their life, and that there is always hope.

So there I was, suddenly six digits in debt, and upset about the loss of my best friend.  I decided I was going to be ""strong"".  I was going to keep my problems to myself and present a normal front.  The bills piled up and I started to skip class to get high.  I had smoked and drank socially before, but now I was abusing it.  The months stretched on, and around January I was at the end of my leash.

I decided to tough it out and try to graduate.  I didnt make it that far.  After weeks of only leaving the couch to buy more booze and pot, I snapped.   I drove home from college when I knew my parents were at work with the intention of getting my gun out of the safe to end it all.  As I opened the safe, I felt something well up.  I dont want to call it a will to live, but something I have since come to call ""survival mode"".

Instead of a gun, I pulled out my passport and hopped back in my truck.  A few hours later I had sold my truck and pawned a few valuables.  Ten grand in hand, I bought back-packing gear and a plane ticket to Paris.  24 hours later I was in Europe.

I spent a few weeks in Europe, in contact with myfamily only via facebook.  They were justifiably worried, but they understood my choice.  I was in control again.  I felt super aware of everything going on around me.  Life seemed like a distant problem, I was busy having an adventure.  After a few weeks and some odd adventures, I found myway home.

Therapy helped me find my center.  I realized that happiness is a state of mind, and that friends and famiky always care.  Strangers even care if you reach out to the right people.  Taking your own life is a perminent solution to what is probablya temporary problem.

I was able to finish my degree and now work as a Brand Manager in a well known marketing firm.  I love life and am off of the lexapro I took at the beginning of my therapy.

So, I don‚Äôt want to make anyone sad or anything, but every night I find myself thinking of ways to kill myself. Stab myself to death? Pills? Slit my wrist? Beat myself to death? Starve myself? I always plan on killing myself the next day, as you can see, I never do. I think I‚Äôm such an ugly, selfish bitch, but I just don‚Äôt know. I think I‚Äôm a loser, a bitch, a $!ut, (sorry I just don‚Äôt like that word) an asshole, selfish. I just can‚Äôt come to killing myself, I don‚Äôt even have a reason, do I need one? I also fucking hate my body, I‚Äôm too fat, my hands are to big, my arms aren‚Äôt skinny enough, my hair is too short for a girl, my face is too fat, too pimply, and too freckly. I‚Äôm just a lesbian freak, I get bullied for liking girls. I FUCKING HATE LIFE IN THIS WORLD",suicide

346220,"For the first time in a long time suicide seems pretty reasonableI am an addict.  I work my ass off for barely enough money to drink and smoke my drinks and smokes of choice.  I have been struggling for ten years with this.  

I am a big naive idiot, too.  I get myself fucked over by the sharks we call humans regularly.  Now it seems my living arrangement is going to be shut down and I have nowhere to go.  I do think I will be homeless in a month or two.  

I am sick of this shit 100%.  My family is nearly done with me so like fuck I am going to mention it to them.  

I have struggled with suicidal tendencies for half my 30 year life, and now I am alone in a fucked up city being fucking evicted for the second time in a year through the fault of being naive and trusting and I can honestly say that fantasies of death are taking me over.  I have plans, concrete ones, that I can execute.  I need a little hardware first.  I was gonna wait for my remaining parent to die first but honestly what's the point if I can't even begin to get my shit together?  Why even live like an example of failure when I could be remembered as having so much potential?  

Last weekend I came close to checking in the ER.  Parts of me surely want to live.  Yeah at this point fulfilling my plans seems like a really good option.  I think about it every day many times.  Way more than I had been.

I am just so tired of picking myself up off the ground I think I would rather become a part of it.

I don't know why I am here.  Because I have to miss work if I report to the ER.  I don't want to hurt my family.  All my dreams are dead.  Unattainable and locked behind the panic and fear which ties me to the dirt I long to become.  I am alone and beyond that I am fundamentally lonely and unable to express myself in even the simplest of ways.  I believe in the core of my being that I will never make myself understood and my life will be a stammering disgrace just as it has been for thirty. fucking. years.

Sorry.  Posts like this are why I unsubscribed but I am at my wits' end and it's either here or the ER that I am aware of somebody who I can talk to.",suicide

346231,"A rant about hinduism. I find all the hinduphobia really disheartening and I'm starting to loose faith because of it. I also really hate the tricks the exhindu subreddit pulls out to defame hinduism even though most of its explainable. An example is the story of the fortunate one in Shrimad Bhagvatam where Shiva supposedly kidnaps a womanl (though the excerpt they showed didn't mention kidnapping) And how he chased after her while ejacualting and the discharge fell on the earth and that's how valuable metals like gold and platinum were formed . While this might seem like a horrendous act at first, its actually a Leela taken by Shiva to impart a lesson. The main teaching of the story is that anyone, even the Adhiyogi Shiva can be disillusioned by Maya and it is important to recognise when we are deluded by it. It even says at the end of the story "" Shiva, realising he was chasing after an illusion, stopped and repented"" or something along those lines. I have lots of other examples. Like a story of how Vishnu raped his devotee Vrinda, giving no other context other than this line. The actual story is that the demon Jalandhar who is married to Vrinda had a boon which would make him immortal until his wife lost her chaste. Thus Jalandhar attacked the home of the devas and lord Shiva was unable to kill him. Vishnu, knowing that he had no other choice, disguised himself as Jalandhar, returned to Vrinda home and took her chaste. Jalandhar was thus mortal and Shiva could kill him. Now, this doesn't even mean it was rape, as it could have been a kiss, a hug or a simple platonic touch of feet. Vrinda, upon learning the truth, caused Vishnu that he would not be worshipped in the form of an idol. Vishnu, knowing that he had sinned, accepted the curse graciously. And when Vrinda killed herself, He granted the gift of eternal life by turning her into a tulsi plant, which is why the tulsi is so revered. In both cases, the deeper meaning of the story and context were not even presented, showing clear bias and propaganda.

Anyways, my rant is over.",non-suicide

I texted my Dad that I was sick and it would be better if so didn‚Äôt do my chores so I could prevent spreading anything I could possibly have. 

I guess he didn‚Äôt get the text or see it because he came into my room at the end of the day asking if I had done everything and I said no and told him no because I was sick and didn‚Äôt want to spread anything but he argued ‚ÄúBut you have enough energy to be on the phone?‚Äù

346258,"Starving to deathI don't know what to do anymore. The Government is forcing me to stay at home, in the UK, and I'm not receiving any sorts of benefits, after having applied for them all. I have no money left, no food in the fridge, I am starving. Since this virus has started I have been applying non stop for jobs, but nothing. I don't know what to do anymore, the bills keep piling u, my phone provider stopped giving me service because I missed the bills because I was saving money for food, which I don't even have anymore. I don't know what to do I feel like my country and everyone has forgotten about me? How long till I have no more heating? Gas? Electricity? I don't know what to do I have been suicidal since I was a kid, but never before have I lent into it this much. I cant get it off my mind it seems like the logical answer, I'm just going into debt trying to stay alive. 

I'm not sure what to do anymore, I have tried asking for help, people say ask for the benefits, which I cant get. I don't have any friends or family, and me and my girlfriend broke up just before this all started. I don't know if even there is a point. If I don't directly kill myself I will die from starvation. I feel betrayed by the government for forcing me to stay at home when the death toll is like a bad seasonal fly. I feel betrayed by the news for pushing the agenda that everyone needs to stay at home. I feel betrayed by the government again because they closed my account, where they give out free money to everyone affected. 

I don't know what to do and I don't want to die of starvation, I just want an easy way out, that is all. does anyone have any good methods? I don't have a car. What are the chances I will die if I jump in front of a train? It will have to be at a station so it will be going slow. What about toaster in the bath? 

I have always hated myself, and I always thought that would be the pushing factor to a suicide, not a virus... 

Please someone give me a method. A good, reliable method. I don't have anything, I live alone, I'm going to die anyway, please give me a method. I cant do this anymore, starving wondering when everything is going back to normal, someone out there must have a working method? Pleasee",suicide

346273,"Inconsequential RamblingsI've been through some hard times. But they were a long time ago. I've come to understand that the troubles in my life now are a result of the shit I went through over 7 years ago now. Not directly. There comes a time in everybody's life when they realize they are responsible for their choices and I certainly am. But can I be held accountable for what happened to me?

People don't change. Life doesn't change. Not without cutting ties and a massive effort that most people aren't really capable of. Maybe myself included. Idk. I'm trying now though. I'm back in school but I'm stumbling across the same bull shit problems that I did the last time around 4 years ago. Seclusion. 

When you have a hard time in your life that doesn't go away quickly it really fucks you up. Every day I faced dread that most of my peers had never experienced and never will. Prolonged exposure to that sort of shit changes a person. Literally changes you. Your synapses change. Different neural pathways become ingrained like trenches, ruts that become almost impossible to climb out of. Your brain fucks itself to cope. Add isolation to the concoction and the result is one train-wreck of a personality. I.E. Me. 

My dad died suddenly and without warning and my mom confessed her suicidal thoughts to me. I was still just a boy. Fucked up man. Gone forever was the happy family. Gone forever. Gone in a god damn instant with so little left that you almost wondered that it even existed in the first place. Holding onto the memories is like grabbing smoke. 

The shit continued as years later her being a widow can't afford the house anymore so we lose it. My fucking home. The place I grew up. Gone now likely forever. I'm holding out a place in my heart that someday I will be successful enough to buy it back but despite my sincere fucking efforts in school now I feel I am only acting in vain. There is just too much. My thoughts run depraved and desperate and just by my demeanor I alienate myself. I am alone in the crowd. Going through the motions. Smiling. Polite. Happy. Normal.

346279,"My dog is the only thing keeping me from killing myselfI've been dealing with bipolar disorder since adolescence. It was well-managed for over two years (since my last institutionalization for suicidal ideation in 2014). My dad and I were as close as any father and son could ever be. He died of nasopharyngeal cancer in august. It was fucking horrific. He gradually lost his vision and his ability to talk. His weight was down to about 80 pounds. Hardly a day goes by without remembering him fondly, and then thinking about holding his hand as his heart rate and oxygen levels dropped to zero and the monitor displayed ""alarm discretely activated.""

I moved to a new city and adopted a rescue puppy, who quickly became my best friend. At first, things were good, but recently some events transpired that could greatly reduce my quality of life for years to come. I'm shitty about this, and now I'm off the wagon (yeah, I'm also an alchy and I'm wasted rn). As of now, my dog is the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning.

We see a guy with a beard, kind of looking like a mess and they say ""he doesn't look like he went to college"" so I say....how the fuck would you know...and I got mocked ???? It's so backwards. My mom woke me up to drive her to get cigarettes, but when I would wake her up to ask if I could go out with friends (who would pick me up, I just needed her permission) she would ask why I woke her up....and now my dad expects me to drive over his house whenever, but he never ever drove me anywhere when I couldn't drive...I told him that too and he got so mad, he said ""never talk to me again"" ...you're really that dramatic you wouldn't talk to your DAUGHTER again because I talked back to you? And now i do it more often and it always ends up with me feeling shitty but I never thought I was in the wrong until I realized I must be. Why else would it be so hard for me to have normal conversations with people? I don't understand my parents at all and I wish they were just....less annoying really, I don't have patience for this. I see my dad like twice a month, I never talk to him, well he never texts me. Yeah the phone works both ways but you're the father.....and He thinks I'm making millions of dollars as a cashier or something and contantly asks me for money...where the fuck do you think I'm getting money from? And why does it take so long to pay me back? You say you're making more than the average American a year so why are you asking your teenager daughter for cash...I can't comprehend....he thinks my life revolves around money and I really don't care but he keeps talking to me about money and how I'm so strict with it...you really don't know me if that's what you think. There's something seriously wrong with him I think. I hate to say it but so many times I question him. I know my reality is a little weird but he's living in another ducking world and I'm so stressed over it. Our relationship feels almost non-existent, it's making it really easy for me to say goodbye. That's awful isn't it? 


People always say ""think about how your parents will feel if you killed yourself"", I just don't care anymore though, it doesn't feel like they care too much about me. My dad says he wants me to succeed and so does my mom but it's like...you're not helping me at all and I can't do this by myself.

I just recently alienated a friend because as a bisexual I sent him a wall of text and he said it was a misunderstanding. But for normal people that means I won't contact you or hang out anymore. So fuck. I'm alone and I've made myself that way.

How can I be a normal 20 year old when I have shitty social skills, no sense of style, a pretentious ego and I'm stuck at home with no driver's license or job (nor experience)?

I don't know what I'm looking for, where to start or what. I have therapy. I have pills for bipolar disorder. But I'm stuck catching up as people have good times. Do you know what I mean?

Sorry for this rambling wall of text, I Just feel like shit and am thinking about suicide.",suicide

346326,"I NEED HELP PLEASE?!?!?!I keep reliving my traumas. I'm constantly burning and I just want to be put out. I'm tired. I just want to sleep forevermore without dealing with it. I'm getting help but still. Not saying I will kill myself but there are often times I have the thought of doing it and sometimes I'm worried I'll do it so in case it happens I would like to ensure the future of my 2 cats and dog.

They're not just ordinary animals either. They are my children. My equals in every way. If I had to I would gladly give my life up just to save theirs. It may seem foolish to take a ""dog and cat life"" so seriously but please understand I do. I love them so much. I am just worried that if I were to slip one day I want to make sure all are okay if/when I am gone. 

Both my cats were saved from circumstances and are very close to one another and would have to be together FOREVER while my dog, could stay with my mom's husband but he is old and doesn't take care of himself well. I have a strong feeling something will happen to him before my dog. I would like the person who would adopts my cats to also keep an eye on my mom's husband so in case something does happen to him my dog will go to that trusted person who will take my cats as well.

I'd like someone to adopt them who will guarantee me that they'll won't be given away to a shelter or separated. By someone who'd also be willing to adopt my dog later on down the lines as well. I'd prefer a young family who is established who can ensure my cats will remain indoors. While if my moms husband wouldn't be able to take care of my dog or if he dies that person(s) will immediately get my dog no matter what so she won't wind up in some shelter and fucked up like when I first received her. It took her such a long time to get out of that disposition.

I promise I am seeking help for my suicidal thoughts and tendencies. I am going to counseling and therapy, potentially getting myself institutionalized, Health Suicide Hotline on speed-dial, communicating to others of my tendencies, and taking many other platforms and help to improve myself but I don't go down that dark path. I'm just afraid that I might reach a breaking point to where I won't be able to either take care of them or completely end myself and I wouldn't want them to wind up separated from one another. They are all bonded together. Granted the cats are disclosed to the dog butt they are still pretty close. I just don't want them to have to deal with the f*****-up trauma of going through of going through the pain getting rehomed. I also don't want to have to worry about them whining up in an abusive situation and so forth.

They're just like humans. Still go through traumas and psychological difficulties if they were to be giving up so easily. I've already tried rehoming my cats and the results weren't good. I had them rehomed temporarily in a place where they could be held for 30 days while I got my s*** together and it was just bad. They were just put in a cage and though they were interacted with it just wasn't the same like a loving home environment with people who would interact with them. They didn't eat, they made out a lot, their nerves were so shocked that they had bad diarrhea, and even when they were put together in the same cage and cuddled what's the weather in love to comfort them. And that was just overall in a matter of the week. It really f*** them up. I wasn't giving them away either. I was just putting my cat somewhere I believe that if they could taking care of well I got myself together they'd be fine but they were it. It really messed them up. Since they've been home all day done is sleep but they're going to the bathroom just fine and they're eating. They're starting to get into their playful moods again. When I went to go retrieve them to from that pet sitting place they both left onto me and held onto me so hard with their claws digging into my skin.

As for my dog I know I couldn't do it because she would have it worse. She'd be cowering in a corner shaking not even eating or drinking not even wanting to get touched or anyting. She would likely die within a matter of days.

All these animals are very sweet I promise. They just wouldn't be able to be separated from each other or put in a cage like that. They would need a stable loving home that is quiet with people who would love them and consider their psychological issues just as equally as important as a human's.



Please, anybody out there who'd be willing to talk to me about these arrangements I'd appreciate it. All I want is to ensure that if something were to happen to me my animals will be safe and secure. I'm working on getting help but I would just like to create a backup plan just in case something happens my children will be secured since nobody is willing to take their lives seriously other than myself.",suicide

346337,"Any advice?So I came inches away from losing my boyfriend today... (Im 18 hes 16... yes gay couple) Death by train, I'm not sure how I would have reacted if he actually followed through, because I'm torn just thinking about it.
A little background, we met online about a year and a half ago, we have since been dating a little over a year now, things seem like all is going great. I knew he had many mental issues going into the relationship, it was difficult at first always seeing him so down in the dumps... But I sort of learned to cope with these new obstacles. He has major anxiety, ADD, suicidal tendencies, and also has bipolar depression... It's a bit to juggle, I've done really well up to this point. 
Him telling me something like this let me know there is hope for him, part of him wants to still live. There is alot of pain in his life, his family life sucks his parents divorced and remarried so many times, his father verbally and emotionally abusing him, his mother a complete alcoholic. Family always fighting. Grudges all around. Caught in the middle of this surrounded with friends with similar issues, doesn't seem to help much... This definitely isn't the first attempt and I'm certain it's not going to be the last... :/ 
I've voiced my concern and invited him to seek some sort of help... I know force isn't going to help anything here, all I can do is let him know I'm here for him always. 
Due to his anxiety and situation with his parents it has lead to him having fear of commitment, not commitment issues if that makes sense. Being raised around divorced parents watching so many failed attempts of a relationship you lose your faith in love, he's seen and dealt with it firsthand far too many times. Another point is from seeing this pain he is afraid to build up any more relationship than we have in fear that when it ends it will all have a much much worse affect. 
We still love each other truely... I'm just at a loss here on how to help him... Losing him would be hell... Although I have tried to at least prepare myself for the worst if he did decide to follow through...
Any worthwhile advice would be appreciated, if you have any questions I'll try my best to answer them all.

346347,"My dad is apparently stupid... I am sorta mad right now and I need a place to vent. So here we go:

So my dad is a great guy, he really is. But some of the things he thinks just blow my god damn mind. Let's start with the first thing. He is a trump supporter. That's not the problem though, I couldn't care less who you vote for. He was talking on the phone with his buddy in the kitchen, and you know what I overheard? Him saying he thinks that the mail-in ballots were faked and frauded. I told him that that just isn't true and that you should stop being salty that Biden won. He has been really pissed ever since Biden got elected (well, sorta elected). He then asked me to see this video from Trump's attorney. to paraphrase it, She basically said that this company that had faked votes for other countries was doing the same for the left-winged party. I told him not only did that sound like something a conspiracy theorist would say on Facebook, but also that trump probably paid that attorney bank to say that.

Second Thing. So I listen to a lot of rap music. I also watch a lot of rap YouTubers. So my account is also downstairs (Cause I watch youtube in the living room sometimes). The reason I don't care if it is down there is that no one else besides my little sister uses youtube in my house. So apparently there is this documentary only on youtube called the trump card. My dad wanted to watch it, so he uses my account, and what does he see in the recommended? A rap video.

So He is gonna go and get dinner for the family. He tells me that he wants me to come with him because he wants to talk to me about something, When we're in the car, he tells me that he saw my youtube history and found rap videos. He then went on to say how those videos are evil and will brainwash you. I told him that you are crazy if you think that anyone with common sense would rob a house because he heard a rapper say he did it. He then told me I wasn't allowed to watch youtube and that he would be checking my history to make sure I wasn't on it. 

Luckily, I have an alt youtube account that no one knows about. so I just watched youtube on that. so yea, I'm fucking pissed right now.

346348,"Feeling worthless and depressedI am a male offspring whose nature didn't give too much to be grateful for. Apart from the face, body shape and iq I have nothing to be grateful for. Maybe for the fact that I live. I have psychiatric disorders (severe depression and multiple personality disorders) and also I'm not tall and don't have a big penis. I've been told countless times by women to  : go fuck myself, leave Europe and move to Asia, I will never stand a chance nor even have the slightest thought of having children. Apart from the fact that I keep decent relations at college and work, I am obsessed with my size, revolving anything around height and penis size. EG: I hear women laugh means they must be fucked by a big dick . I see women happily togheter only with tall guys.(I somehow bypass shorter ones) . I assume that no matter how dumb, ugly, uneducated a man is if he is tall and has a big dick he will have more chances to have an offspring than some educated , gentelmanly, and caring man. As a side-note I also believe that women who comment on the ""small penis"" and ""short"" threads are only giving support to their fellow peers because a man with that problems will try to compensate(which is not possibile in my oppinion (height/penis size are physical you can't compensate them with something else than physical)) and be a caring nice sensitive men a CUCKOLD for another TALL and HUNG man's offspring. Those women want to help other women get their nice guys by encouraging them not to kill themselves because (life is beautiful  and other bullshit ) while sleeping with genetically superior guys which didn't work at the provider aspect. I am currently paralized and the thought of even refusing to try is devastating. There are some situations when I see a girl I'd like to hook up and know in my head that I will make a fool of myself and more women will find out about my size. I didn't use to be this way. However after some women (~10) told me in one way of another that I don't measure up I started thinking : maybe I dont, maybe that's why those relationships didn't work, maybe that's why women are laughing behind my back. In spite of all the offenses and emasculating phrases directed to me I kept and still keep my self-respect and integrity and not even let anybody know that I face this challenge.

My brother had been battling crippling depression for years and just turned 30 right before Xmas. He left home yesterday morning, said he was just ""Going out for awhile, probably gonna see some friends."" he did that very often, almost every weekend so we didn't think much of it.

Around dinnertime a police chaplain showed up at our door and informed us that my brother had committed suicide about an hour and a half north of the city yesterday afternoon. Due to jurisdiction, his body was taken to their central hub, which is about 3 hours north of here. 

I'm taking time off from work to grieve and help my dad get things squared away and support him. To be honest while the suicide was shocking, it wasn't terribly surprising, as horrible as that sounds. We tried to reach out to him but he would never accept or seek help. 

My dad doesn't really want to just throw away all of his belongings. I think he wants to donate them to somewhere that could use them. He has a lot of clothes obviously that could go to a Goodwill though I'm wondering if there's some other resource that could put them to better use, or even possibly donate them to OWS.

He also was very big into model airplanes. His room is stacked to the ceiling in a corner with boxes of model kits. He's won numerous awards for his craftsmanship and I'm sure that the unused kits could see some use at a children's home or something. We plan on holding onto a few keepsake-esque items but we just want to know where to take the rest.

I am from South Africa and COVID-19 plus a run of bad luck ruined my life. I lost my job 6 months ago. Company shut down due to COVID-19. In the same month, found out that my wife is pregnant - we've been married for 2 years. And in the same month, both my parents contracted COVID-19.

Fast forward to today - wife is heavily pregnant, both parents passed away and still no job. Just some odd jobs here and there. There are nights I pretend not to be hungry just so that my wife and my young brother can eat.

I never thought that someone as outwardly strong as I am could wake up earlier that my wife each morning to cry. I have to hide tears from my wife and hope each day I find some small job to do that can help us to eat.

Saturday I got a one-day job offloading trucks for 14 hours. Got paid R500 (about $29). We ate well but this week its back to square one.

To top it all off, I damaged my spine with the heavy lifting &amp; currently I am not able to get out of bed. Our neighbor took me to the doctor and he says I have a slipped spinal disc which will need some sort of surgery in order to re-align. To top it all off, the landlord is tired of the delays in rent payment and has asked us to move out at the end of this month.

Savings all gone and now I think I might be physically incapable of taking care of my family. My wife has been asking for help from relatives too but I'm sure they are tired of us now.

However, with her boyfriend, things have not been going well. He‚Äôs been distant, refuses to communicate, and just doesn‚Äôt seem to care.

The day they got together was the day that she planned to kill herself. But she stopped... he stopped her. And now, their relationship is falling apart. What‚Äôs more, is she only sees her boyfriend face to face twice in a week, and even then they aren‚Äôt alone.

She‚Äôs dug herself into a ditch, and it‚Äôs not going well for her. She‚Äôs tethered herself to a person who can‚Äôt even return the love and affection any relationship calls for.

I work in healthcare and am so sick of my fucking workplace. They don‚Äôt give a shit if we get sick, despite 30 employees having covid and 6 outbreaks they‚Äôve now started rationing masks more. I live alone and have no ‚Äúbubble‚Äù because I‚Äôm treated like I have the fucking plague even when I‚Äôm willing to do distanced masked walks and I get tested regularly. I want to quit my job, but i know the economy is shit right now and I‚Äôm lucky to even have a job so I‚Äôd be making things worse for myself quitting.

I‚Äôm addicted to otc opiates (we have them in canada) and prescribed benzos that I originally got to try to quit the opiates. I started abusing both very badly after getting cheated on by my last ex. I really wanted a family with her, but am trans and one of her motivating factors for cheating/leaving me was that I wasn‚Äôt normal like other guys. 

I went and spent 15k (the rest was covered) to get surgery in another country, 3 skin grafts later a lot of pain etc and now I have a penis. I‚Äôm happy with my body but still feel it will never be good enough for anyone else. 

I quit drugs briefly after surgery as I was happy with my body for once and had a few people reaching out to me just out of curiosity regarding the surgery. I then got really depressed about the fact that I went through it all by myself and healed by myself. 

Things have been getting worse day by day and the more I go to work the more I contemplate suicide. I fixate on my ex who doesn‚Äôt want me back, I fixate on the isolation I feel in general. I spend most days in bed crying until I have to go to work. 

I said I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself because I was afraid of becoming a vegetable and I also felt bad for my dog. He‚Äôs the only creature I feel actually loves me on this earth. It‚Äôs just too much though and now I‚Äôm at the point that I‚Äôm caring less if I end up a vegetable, I could at least leave a note to tell my parents to disconnect life support.

346472,"I am completely and utterly unlovable and it's all my fault.I'm sitting here at my nephew's birthday party with loads of happy people around me and I just want to cry.

Yesterday I emotionally abused a boy I knew only three days. I absolutely loved everything about him, and most of all I loved that he seemed to genuinely like me.

And what did I go and do? I couldn't believe that he liked me, so I kept sending him messages asking if he did, and if he didn't respond right away I'd want to cry. Eventually I took like 10 paracetamol (nowhere near enough to kill me) and told him I took pills. I did it as some sort of sick punishment for him doing absolutely nothing.

And after I calmed down and told him to run as far away from me as he could he STILL wanted to at least be friends with me. If I continue to talk to him I *will* hurt him, and I want to tear myself apart. Hell I want to do it now. There is a balcony with a short drop outside. Maybe I can break my neck.

I can't be loved because I make it impossible to love me. I want desperately - desperately - to love and be loved, but I can't do it. I can't. I want to sleep forever.

Edit: I just sent him this message:

&gt; I am complete poison to you. Run away as fast as you can. I promise I won't kill myself, but don't talk to me anymore. You need to do this because when I become emotional I won't be able to stop myself. Even if you just wanted to be friends I would continue to abuse and hurt you. I absolutely do not deserve forgiveness for my actions yesterday. I have known you three days and already taken pills and threatened suicide. This is not acceptavle behaviour.

&gt; I'm not going to lie and tell you there isn't a part of me that hopes you'll read this and go ""Oh I'll never leave you"" but I am fighting very very hard against it.

I just wanted to check in with you about how things are going.  Your song topic made me worry a bit and hope that you're not relating too much with Jeremy.  Also, you mentioned in class about your medication, and I wanted to follow up and see how you're doing with that.   I'm not a counselor or a clinician, but if you ever need to talk I can be a sounding board and can help you locate resources if you need anything.
 
Hope you're doing well.""


I choose a presentation on the song ""Jeremy"" by Pearl Jam for Adolescent psychology presentation.  If you do not know what it is about, a 16-year-old boy committed suicide in front of his classmates.  This song is powerful and chilling at the same time and that is why I chose it; also felt appropriate for the class because many adolescents deal with suicidal thoughts...including me.


A little back story about my suicidal thoughts...they started to arise in my junior year in high school, so around the age of 16 or 17.  I am currently 19 and I am a sophomore in college.  The thoughts started to appear one day when I was feeling depressed over school work and I'm pretty sure a crush that just broke my heart.  I thought nothing of this because 1.) I don't have the guts to kill myself and 2.) I thought every teenager experienced these thoughts.  I have cut myself numerous times when I was in high school, but no one knew about them because they were on my leg.


Also, a bit about my personality: I am very easy-going on the outside.  I am always willing to listen to people and I probably would describe myself as a ""wallflower"".  I have never had parent issues and they are really supportive of me and my way of life.  I have a decent amount of friends and I usually have normal college conversations with them.  I have one really close friend that we can share anything, but I haven't had the courage to tell her about my suicidal thoughts.  I also have a girlfriend, but we have only been dating a few weeks so I can't really open up too much with her.  She also parties a little bit; I don't at all and have never had the interest in drinking.


Fast-forward to now and I have started to think about suicide all over again.  The end of my freshman year was when they came back because my girlfriend of a year and some months told me she didn't love me anymore.  I started to write poems about this and how I just wish everything would come to an end (I also wrote poems in my junior and senior years of high school with suicidal thoughts).  They really started to progress this year, my sophomore year, when I would be driving and would hope that a car or train (I go to college by a major railroad) would hit me and just end it.  They have been off and on for about two months now, but again they are just thoughts.



The medicine that my professor was talking about was Celexa because I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.  The first week I was on it, the thoughts completely stopped, but I was ungodly tired.  It has been two weeks and the thoughts of suicide are coming back.  They haven't been extremely strong thoughts, but I have picked up my entire pill bottle once and thought about just ending it all.  All in all, Celexa hasn't increased my thoughts about suicide and I believe it has stopped some of my self-diagnosed depression.

I feel pathetic for letting my past shit influence me to this day, but even if I got over this it doesn't make my 20's come back. And really, it looks like all downhill from here - I'm gonna get older and uglier, my parents are gonna get older and get sick, I'll have more responsibilities and less opportunities for enjoyment. 

What's funniest about all this is that these years of wasting my life have been like 10 times happier than the years before when I was actually trying. Maybe I've achieved max happiness and don't know it yet.

346515,"Need some advice on crisis services and help in Canada. Have severe distrust Hello all,

Thank you first and foremost for reading my post. I find myself in a position right now where I fear I might be spiralling. The suicidal thoughts have not completely taken over, however I'm afraid they will. I'm all alone at the moment, in between places, in between everything. As such, please I cannot ask anyone for help I am so very alone on this.

My concern/questions is regarding crisis services in Canada. I am very afraid to call the crisis line and text them in fear they get my number and track me.

This starts from an event that happened almost a year ago. Last year, in Montreal at Montreal general hospital, I faced a situation in which I cannot so far, recover from. One night I had been drinking, feeling like shit, I probably provoked this situation but a person I truly love called the authorities on me for suicide.

They barrelled into where I was staying, I was just at that point trying to eat, get w sense of normalcy. They cuffed me despite me pleading with them not to. There was no sign of a suicide attempt, no weapons, no anything. They berated me, told me it's the law and they will forcefully take me against my will. They searched through my things without my permission, they took IDs that they needed, they forced me in the cuffs. I told them I had nobody to vouch for me, I was alone. They were so incredibly rude, they treated me like I was insane and forced me to the hospital.

Montreal General is seriously spread thin. They do not have any resources whatsoever to cover whatever emergencies they get through, let alone a forced admission. They were unhappy to see me take a bed as they had to immediately check me in. I begged them to go home, I tried to call anyone, my whole family is overseas and they did not want me there. They forced me in a bed in a crowded hallway where I slowly started to unravel. I begged to see anyone, a doctor to let me leave. They told me tough luck you wait for tomorrow morning when the doctor has time. They called me selfish constantly despite me not wanting to be there and for asking to see a doctor so I can leave. After about 3 hours of this berating I made a bad judgement and insisted to leave.

They strapped me, forced my clothes off and put me in a robe. They told me I lost my privilege in keeping my regular clothes on. They proceeded to inject me with 4 different rounds of Ativan, none of them did anything. Ativan is supposed to relax people but since they did not bother to ask, they were unaware that I am severely resistant to Ativan and it tends to raise my blood pressure. I became more anxious, more alert on it. Their response was to keep injecting me. One of the nurses, not a doctor, when I told her shes wasting her time giving me Ativan decided to give me her two cents. She said she thinks I'm ? Tbh I don't even remember anymore bipolar? Disaccosiative? All these are not conditions I have. I have seasonal depression and chronic anxiety, I've seen several professionals for this.

I told her that she's not allowed to back seat diagnose me and that I can complain. She became hyper aggressive and told me that no one will listen to me as I am basically not worth the time.

The next morning, the specialized doctor shows up, I tell him I don't need his help, he discharges me. After all that happened I was not interested in their treatment. He made no effort whatsoever to try to treat me either. A GP shows up, checks my vitals and notes that I am having an abnormal reaction to the drugs in my system. I insist on a discharge anyway despite their concern.

I went home, it was a blur but I went home. Since that day, I have absolutely refused to speak about a single issue in my life. My significant other left me as well and I have nothing tethering me to life. I am using an alt, I refuse to see anyone. Everytime I remembered, for a while, what I went through I truly and honestly consider ending it because if that's the ""solution"" then clearly it's not worth pursuing.

Now, maybe I am ready to talk about this. I know for a fact that many of the things that transpired were wrong.

I see no meaning or purpose in my life. I haven't experienced any real pleasure in ages. In fact, I do not even know what makes me happy anymore. I haven't laughed out loud in years. Food doesn't interest me. I sometimes yearn to go live in a foreign land, but then I think I can't survive there.


I am 27, and live in a developing country. I know I might have a really skewed perception of the world. I believe everybody is bad, mean, dirty and just out to make money. I am educated, but I think I will not fit into the culture of a developed country even if I immigrate (things like table manners, parties, drinks, events are alien to me.)

She(my friend) told us that her mom allowed her to go the day before, but she(her mom) was surprised to see her dressed up and ready to go on the day of the party and consequently didn't allow her to come.

346578,"Hi Reddit, made a throwaway to vent my story. Anna Karenina says it all. So, I'm a redditor for a few years now, this is my first ""throwaway"" account. My story is similar to Anna's if you know the Tolstoy novel. I haven't read the novel, though, just the latest movie. But I'm a big Tolstoy fan and have read much of his work.

Anyhow. I'm 35. My husband is 50. My ..what do you call one you are having an affair with..? him. he's 38. My husband, we'll call Mr. B. and my other we'll call Dr. X.  I've known Dr X for .. 18yrs, married to Mr B for 10. I have been having an affair for 5 months now, but it took a sudden turn a little over a week ago. 


Dr X livs 4,000 miles away, we haven't seen each other lately since the affair started, so it's emotional, as sexual as you can get at this distance. We're seeing each other in a couple of weeks. 


Dr X called me drunk. It's been a non-emotional thing so far. It's been ""this is just sex b/c we were so hot together 12 yrs ago"" type of thing.. he was my college BF for a very hot summer. But was my Bestie for 8 yrs before that. So we're close, but i've made it clear that this is not emotional. its just sex. i have said that blatently. 

So Dr X, drunk, starts saying why did i leave him? why didn't i wait for him (he went away for a year to scotland for his phd), why didn't i know he wanted me? he made a big mistake, he was scared. but he never said ""love"" except then he said he would very ""lovingly""(that word) kiss me. 


I'm at the point in my marriage that I'm done, but not done, either. And all of this is so confusing that I end up drunk/high and suicidal nightly. Because it's tormenting. Does Dr X love me? Is he in love wiht me? what does that mean?? And if he doesn't, and if ther'es nothing there, I can't live in this marriage and I dont know that I can get out of it. My husband threatens suicide when I've threatened to leave (many times over the years, most recently tonight).


I've had a few shots of vodka, smoked a bunch, and I'm pretty sick on top of being bi polar and on my period. I know I'm not going to kill myself tonight, but I am starting to plan and what's so strange is there's a serenity about it. I've done all I can. I wanted more. But if I can't have more.. and I dont mean Dr X. Dr X is just the promise that this marriage could end, I could possibly get out of it, there could be hope of something more interesting out there for me. I still want to live in Europe for 2years and visit where I grew up. This marriage will never allow me to go home. It wil not allow me to travel, it will not allow me to breathe. I am in a beautiful gilt cage. I am well taken care of, I have all I want, Mr B gives me anything my heart desires and then some. But I can't travel, I can't live where I'd like to live, I can't pursue some of my dreams. Do I give them up? Do I live in this beautiful prison? 


can't stop the spirits when you need to
this life is more than just a read through

I just wanted to vent. But i'll also take advice. Oh and yes, I am in love with Dr X, always have been, when he left me, I got married to leave the state and try to forget him. It didn't work. And here we are. How does he feel? Can anyone tell? and anyone else felt that serenity once you just... totally... give up?

Okay. This is going to be a lot.

So I won't say my name, but I will say that I have always been ""a fuck up"" for my whole life.

I'm forgetful. I'm clumsy. I'm overly sensitive. I get jealous of others easily. I have a lot of self-esteem issues. I am oblivious to things others find obvious. I ruin long term relationships of pretty much any kind. I procrastinate. I can't stick to my own plans for myself. And now I just got fired from a great job I loved that pays better than any other job I've had except maybe the army if you include the benefits.

I'm 30 years old. I live with my father as of 3 months ago because of financial reasons that I did to myself. I cant go back to school because my loans are defaulted because I ignored them the LAST time I was in a dark place. I can't commute easily because theres very little for public transportation where I live and i dont have a car yet. I have no boyfriend or girlfriend. No friends that I regularly talk to.

346595,"Becoming ""properly"" suicidal more and more oftenI've been depressed for a long time and I've been thinking about suicide increasingly but just sort of accepting it as a possibility. I always assumed that I'd be the ""type"" to at least attempt at some point.

But today I've been forcing myself to really think about it as a real and imminent thing, as real as going to the loo or making a coffee. Just... doing it. And then that's it. And I'm panicking.

Paradoxically i find myself thinking about how everyone who'd ultimately be better off without me but then I'll force myself to think about how it would fuck up the lives of people around me - THEN i feel like a total narcissist for thinking that way and that i have far too high an opinion of myself and don't deserve to put off suicide just for that reason, especially when so many others who have done far better things in their lives do it all the time. It gets particularly bad if i hear about someone famous or who i admire has done it, it makes the voice even stronger that demands to know what my excuse is for hanging on.

In short my mind is fucked at the moment. I don't want to burden any one with these thoughts when I'm most likely going to wuss out of it anyway and then I'll have put everyone through worry for nothing, and also what if this is an ongoing thing? 

I can't speak to a professional, I'm already registered with a mental health service and they are utterly useless and the last ones I'd want to turn to while feeling this way. Because I have aspergers they think I just need to go along to special social groups and learn small talk (I learned how to do it long before they showed up but the problem isn't not knowing it's that it's so hard especially when depressed all the time) and are apparently blocking any form of therapy until I do so. I've told them about feeling suicidal before and they did literally nothing, not even asking me any further questions or anything. Because of this glib attitude they've eroded any willingness to show them any vulnerability. I have no friends and an overprotective yet often emotionally distant family with plenty of problems of their own.

In fact I couldn't exactly say to them that their problems are a significant contributor to my feeling like this, useless and unable to help with anything, along with the likelihood (a sentiment they keep reinforcing) that life is only going to get worse.

People get uncomfortable and leave, or they get afraid or worried, which leads to them trying to help me while I feel like it's useless to keep trying to explain what's happening.

It destroys me slowly. Trying to say how sometimes the world loses its colours and I feel like it's useless to do anything. Like I'm getting closer to death. My legs struggle to keep me upright and I start to lose my bearings.

All while I hold a fake smile to tell people that I'm fine, so they don't... Well... Leave... Or treat me like the weird, sad, pitiful kid, which happens a lot.

All of this makes me feel like it's even more worthless to try and continue to fight back these feelings anyway...

My mom got scared... My dad doesn't care... My friends don't know what to do, and I don't want them to treat me overly nicely, or worry them to something that maybe resonates inside of them...

So

Maybe I'm sinking alone

But what difference would it make if I did...

Sure, people would be horribly sad

346604,"I dreamed that I loved somebody.I had a dream where I truly loved and trusted a person. I was absolutely sure, without a single doubt, that they felt the same about me. That's the only time I've ever loved or trusted anyone. It felt so good. But that'll never happen. I wish I didn't experience it, because it was fake. It was a fucking dream and now I know what I'm missing, it hurts even more. 

Do people actually love and trust others? I never knew how it felt until I dreamed it. Doesn't matter. I don't care if I'm alone or not, I just want the suffering to stop.

I've been in constant pain since the dream - it's nearly a month now - because somehow, I feel literal physical pain in my heart. Like I'm nearly choking, but just barely able to breathe. I've lost my appetite. I haven't eaten normally since the dream. I'm so tired.

For as long as I can remember, any kind of happiness has just been making everything hurt more. Happiness lasts no longer than a few hours, and it always results in feeling depressed for way longer afterwards. I smile and I laugh and I forget things, but it's not real. I don't think I've ever been truly happy at any point in my life. I've never come close to feeling how I did in the dream. I remember the feeling so clearly.

I wish I never had that dream. I wish I never realized how it's supposed to be. But at the same time, I'm glad I know how hopeless my life actually is.

It will never be real. What's the point? I have no future. I'm not actually living. I'm so sick of this bullshit. Just kill me already.",suicide

346613,"What now?Hi. Props to you if you read this, it is quite long, boring and probably excessively self-indulgent..

So, a couple of years ago, I graduated and after a lot of working for free, found a way into working my full time dream job. Whilst were many areas of my life were unfulfilled, I had stability, inspiration and drive, and a love for life that kept me going. I did deal with the occasional bout of suicidal feelings, as I have PTSD from trauma that occurred through abuse in early life. However, that was why I worked so hard at my career. It was the only thing I had.

I was living at home with my family to begin with. My sister has mental health problems so things weren't exactly stable or peaceful. But I was out of the house for the most part.

So, several months into what was turning out to be the start of an incredible career, my Mum cheated on my Dad, and my Dad threw her out of the house, and me, just for being related to her. It was okay for her, she just shacked up with her then boyfriend, but me? I had no place to go. I wound up sofa surfing, I couldn't cope with the stress, and I had to quit my job. I had no money and ended up living on a credit card. A previous commission turned into ¬£4,000 worth of debt to an employer who wouldn't take my situation into account and who sent the bailiffs after me. I had to cancel my bank accounts. My credit score is fucked, and I can no longer afford the things I needed for my career- or just need in general. Not that it matters now. 

It's been around a year and a half since I was originally made homeless, and I've since moved back in with my mum, who's no longer seeing her dumbass drug addict boyfriend, and while I'm thankful for that, she regularly puts me down, saying I'm lazy, entitled, etc. 

I was working in a retail store until last week, but it was a temporary contract and my employer made me redundant due to lack of business (they are usually busier this time of year, and it was a small, local company..). Although it wasn't what I wanted to do, I was enjoying working there, as my colleagues were very nice. I did feel as though it was a very stagnant, dead end job, though, with no career progression. And for my age, the wage is inappropriate. 

My mother wants me to move out, but how can I when the wages are so low that I'd have to work a 60 hour week just to be able to afford to survive? Surviving, only to get up and work another meaningless, dead-end day, it's fucking killing me. I don't have anybody to be a guarantor for me, so I'd have to probably sublet or something. 

Aside from all of this, a poor diet and lack of money for food over a year and a half means I'm pretty fucking malnourished to be honest, and I honestly think a 60 hour week would literally kill me. 

I don't dream anymore, now, because my dreams are all un-achievable. I don't have any relatives. I don't want to work in care, but that's all there is for me now. I'm really depressed. I'm in a relationship with a guy who is 7 years my senior, has extensive family who care about him, and is achieving his dreams, honestly I'm really jealous of him. He will probably leave me, for somebody better, prettier, healthier, happier, somebody who has lots of family and who doesn't have these problems. 

I tried to call my Dad the other day. He won't pick up the phone to me, and neither will any of my other relatives.

I keep thinking why would anybody want to be with me, because I can't do anything fun, I'm always so unhappy, I don't enjoy anything anymore, music, art, sex, it means nothing to me, and I just feel totally utterly numb. It's like, the despair over the loss of my job and my identity has gone away, and it's just been replaced by this flatness, sadness and lethargy. I used to have so much energy, but my soul has been crushed from everything I've been through. 

I'm so unhappy, I want to just disappear.",suicide
346614,"Self Harming since I was very young, strange behavior as a child, unstable mental health through out all my life and strong symptoms of repressed memories of sexual abuse.My life has never been stable, neither has my mental health. I am a 21 yr old female and recently my depression and suicidal tendencies have been growing stronger an stronger. I know longer feel as if I am my own person, as if everything my body or mind has carried has been stolen from me. I always knew I was 'different', I can't remember a time when I didn't feel that way. As young as 5 (maybe younger) I remember physically hurting myself when I was upset or angry, mainly by winding myself by punching my stomach or scratching my skin. I also had an imaginary friend for a long period of time (2-3 years) who I used to tell everyone he would jump of the roof of our house and die, but then he would return soon after. I've always felt dirty in my own skin, I masturbated frequently from a young age but always had extreme feeling of guilt and self hate once I was finished. My childhood was unstable and with my parents both being drug users they were responsible,either leaving me and sister (2 yr older than me) home alone when we were very young or having a lot of people round at home time so it would be surprising if the history of sexual abuse occurred in my childhood. However, I reached out to my sister to see if she felt like we ever were put in a vulnerable position like that (as i remember very very little of the childhood) and she said no. I also had this flashback once, but it was so strange because for some reason I felt like I was seeing my moms past, when i confronted her, she told me my uncle used to sexually abuse her when she was younger. I am so confused with every area of my life, I have no idea who I am or what happened to me to be SO fucked up since I was so young. Has anyone else experienced anything like the above ? I am so lost, from an outsiders point of view my life is great, but the last drop of happiness in my life fell from my body a long time ago. ",suicide
346616,"I think i fucked upI'm supposed to graduate next year and I still don't know what to do with my life.

I took up guitar and that sparked some hope in me that i could be a musician, until they told me its a hobby and not a job.

When he was in the mental hospital i would always call his parents and make sure he was alive. i stayed awake at nights praying he was ok even though im an atheist.

346632,"a few opinions no one asked for but theyre here anyways 

this subs dry rn and i wanna debate so heres a few opinions that may be controversial:

pls keep it civil, and any personal or derogatory attacks will be blocked and probably reported :D

1) trans people (who have gone through both genitalia surgery and hormonal therapy) arent obligated to tell you theyre trans. 

take it this way: a trans woman used to be a man, that is in their past. no sane person is gonna go to every date and spill out all their hot juicy trauma on the table for you to determine whether you wanna date them or not. dont expect a trans person who completely looks and passes as a cis woman/man to tell you right off the bat that theyre trans. 

in a way, its kinda like getting plastic surgery. most times (if it goes well at least) you cant tell theyve had surgery. so unless you specifically ask ‚Äúhave you had plastic surgery before?‚Äù, that person otherwise has no reason to tell you, unless of course they choose to, which is completely fine. 

base line: if you‚Äôre uncomfortable dating trans people (which i think is kinda okay, with some exceptions), just straight up ask people, dont expect trans people to immediately know that you dont wanna date them because theyre trans, we arent mind readers yknow.

2) cringe culture is the single handedly most annoying thing ever ngl. calling something you simply dont enjoy or are interested in ‚Äúcringe‚Äù is annoying asf. i wish we could go back to the days of ‚Äúif youve got nothing nice to say, dont say anything at all‚Äù.

literally what benefit does it give to anyone to comment ‚Äúlmao ur cringy‚Äù or ‚Äúcringe‚Äù on a post of a topic YOU specifically dont enjoy, but others do? 

and yes i know you want to comment cringe under this post :|

3) most people here on reddit hated on tik tok before it was even widely known that there was spyware. this is mostly connected to my previous point, most people hated on it for being ‚Äúcringe‚Äù. 

dont use that ‚Äúit sexualised kids!!‚Äù argument on me, tik tok did not invent twerking, they did not invent lip syncing, they did not invent pedophilia, get your head out of your ass. 

if youre gonna hate on tik tok for supposedly supporting/advertising minors being sexualised, i hope you put that same energy into literally most websites/apps/forums/groups/videos/photos/compnies etc. on the internet. 

4) not everyone is able to get professionally diagnosed, stop hating on everyone who self diagnoses. sometimes there is genuinely no other option. yes there are people who self diagnose for attention and they are quite literally the scum of the earth, but dont generalise the ones who make the premise of it look bad with everyone else. 

5) fuck reddit, this place is a shithole with constant toxicity. not to mention the upv*te downv*te system makes it easy to not have an opinion and practically force people who care about k*rma to only comment widely accepted ideas rather than what they actually wanna say.

All my life I have struggled with really bad anxiety which leads to me being depressed and sometimes sucudial kind of like today. It really started happening g when I was in the 5th grade. I always kind of make assumptions of what people are thinking about me which I know are almost never true but I still think them and get myself down. Majority of it is all in my head. I take mess for anxiety and depression. I know I have some kind of chemical imbalance in my head because there is no way this is normal. I am graduated now working but not going to college because I hated school and even if it is going to be different like people say. I was going through a really tough time during my senior and junior year of highschool. In senior year I attempted sucicde which put me in lockdown in the hospital for a little over a week. To be honest it was more of a calm for help to my parents but it didn't really do what I had wanted it to. After I was back in school I just stayed home and slept most of the days. I eventually just stopped going and basically dropped out failing a lot of my classes. I didn't want to go back to get my ged so I want and toon the final exams which if I passed I would graduate. I passed both. Now I am just kind of slowly wasting away just starting to feel sad more and more often and I hate it. I just want it all to stop but I can't do anything. A big part of me just always feels alone even when people are with me because I often times doubt that they care so I make it seem like I am all alone. I have had several good friends but most don't last because I don't try and keep it together. I have two good friends now and some online ones which although they care doesn't feel the same. I have had opurtunitys to have a girlfriend as well. During highschoom I was asked out 3 times by different girls but denied all of them thinking to myself that they can do better then me.

I think about how much of a failure I am. I was praised as a ""smart"" child. I grew up thinking that I was destined to be something great.

High school came and went in the blink of an eye. My grades very poor. I couldn't find a reason to do well. ""High school is dumb, college is where it matters"". Here I am in college, I haven't gone to class in 4 weeks because I can't find the motivation.

	Suicide has its benefits. When you are dead, nobody can bother you, hurt you, and all of your problems or future problems will be erased. The very moment you die, your personal problems go with you.

	I know that I have major issues and I need to solve them but no one can help. I do not tell my parents about what is going in my life because of how these problems are caused. Everyday I am angry and depressed and it is not good for me or the relation I am currently in. If I were to die I would not look back at my family. My final thoughts of my life will be of my girlfriend. She is the most special person I have ever met in my entire life and any guy would be lucky to have her if he knows how to relate to her. Whenever I had thoughts of suicide I always thought about her first. My family would never consist. I do not care for my life. I really wish I was never born. I would not be going through the pain I am experiencing now if I was never born or if I was dead a long time ago. If only someone fully understood what I was going through perhaps I would still want to be alive. But even if I do that my problems will never go away. I strongly believe that I am a problem towards my girlfriend as I always start the arguments and get angry with her over the littlest things. So, what do people usually do with problems? Get rid of it. Therefor, I must get rid of myself in the most permanent way possible; dying.",suicide

He easily captivates every girl that befriends him; only one has ever truly captured Benjamin's heart.

346674,"25, heartbroken through my own fault, no friends, no energy, no hopeI've thought seriously about suicide on three occasions in the past two months. One time it took someone coming off his shift at the hospital to hold me back as I was preparing myself to jump off a bridge. I'm scared, but I'm getting to the point that I'm starting to not care anymore as nothing changes after these close calls.

I've had troubles most of my life. My parents were quite old when they had me so I lost all my grandparents and my dad early on. I always struggled making friends, and any that I did made never lasted, in fact we usually ended up as enemies. I stayed away from school as much as I could &amp; spent most of my secondary school days at home watching porn. I just scraped the grades to get into sixth form &amp; then into a good university. Nothing really changed there either though, I always wanted more company but isolated myself and felt like I couldn't fit in. I went off for a working holiday after university and again alienated the first friend I made there and isolated myself. 

One of my very few university friends (3) said her employer were recruiting and I got a job there, where she introduced me to her group of friends. One year on, a girl in the group mentioned her tenancy was running out around the same time as mine and we decided to find a place together even though we weren't very close at all. What ensued was 3 months of finally feeling normal. She matched me in every way, religious beliefs, humour, family upbringing, down to the smallest details. She was the kind of girl that every guy turns to look at. She came from a very well off family. After flirting for months we began a 'relationship'. I didn't treat her right throughout it because of a wide array of issues and fear. But we still became the closest friends we'd ever had, we spent almost every waking moment together, so she saw the real me &amp; I knew her inside out, all the coincides felt like they weren't that at all, but rather this was a gift that was always meant to be, I loved and cared for her more than anything in my life and she did too, but the issues on my side stuck around. 6 months later, I got extremely drunk, I cheated on her, I came clean but it was the one thing she couldn't deal with, and we were done.

The last three months I spent couchsurfing near a job she started a week after my mistake, we met up and got closer occasionally but then I'd push to get back together and ruin everything again. Last weekend was the last straw where we had an event, I promised I would act appropriately but having heard the night before from her that it was best we started stepping away again (she got drunk and called me), I got overwhelmed and basically proved I was incapable of handling my drink and keeping my promises again. This was my dream girl, we both wanted to marry each other, though we never said it until after the mistake. My life felt finally sorted, and now it's worse than ever - issues with my family, a job I can't concentrate on and who seem to be losing faith in me, no home to call my own, no friends still, no energy to face the future, and really no hope. I feel like I ruined a the best thing the universe was ever going to send me, and now I have nothing, I have less than before when I was clinging on to the hope that something great would eventually come my way. I've never felt like I belonged in this world, I was clung on in the hope that someone out there would change my mind. They did, and I basically threw them away, I don't have the will to go on now.",suicide

346688,"Refusing Medical TreatmentI've noticed that in some places, patients have the right to refuse medical treatment.  It also seems that in some cases, this can extend to refusing treatment for a future condition.

Hypothetically, if one were to make a failed suicide attempt and beforehand document that they did not wish to be resuscitated or given any other treatments, would they granted the ability to pass away peacefully?  Would any consideration be given to their written wishes, or can a patient only refuse treatment at the time of the incident if they're deemed to possess the 'mental capacity'?

What is defined as 'mental capacity'? I'd imagine for someone suicidal they would be branded as lacking the necessary rational decision making skills and so wouldn't be granted the right to die after a failed attempt.  How is 'mental capacity' proven?

I'd imagine it all hinges on the person's mental capacity, as otherwise you would be able to refuse psychiatric treatment.

I'm in NSW, Australia if that helps -- but happy for people to provide general information, advice and opinions.

I'd post this on one of the relevant law subreddits, but figured people probably wouldn't be too willing to divulge and instead go into saviour mode.

346690,"So I‚Äôm really upset at my friend right now (I hardly post here, just didn‚Äôt know where to put it. I don‚Äôt necessarily need advice, I just need to spell this out. Thanks to anyone that reads to the end) So I‚Äôm (16 M) kind of pissed at my friend (16 F) right now. Light backstory, I met her online, we‚Äôve known each other 9 months, we‚Äôre best friends. I broke up with my ex, I‚Äôll call her A, about two and a half weeks ago. I always confided in my friend when things were difficult in the 5 months me and her were together, and she always helped me. My friend has a boyfriend, who I‚Äôll call E. The other day, my friend admitted that she used to have feelings for me, and will always ‚Äúhave some bond closer than friendship‚Äù with me, but she won‚Äôt break up with her boyfriend for me, which I get.

So last night I was texting A, we still talk every few days, and she casually mentioned that she had a friend over to her house. That I know, that‚Äôs the first time she‚Äôs had a friend over to her house since we broke up. I still am not 100% over her, 99, but not 100, so that made me a little jealous. That used to be our thing. We met multiple times during quarantine. Two of those times were the best days I‚Äôve had in who knows how long. Anyways, I wouldn‚Äôt tell her that, so I went right to my friend. I type out this long paragraph (we both do it, we write long messages back and forth to each other. It‚Äôs our thing) to her about how I heard from A that she had a friend over, and that made me jealous. I thought I was over her, but I was not. Her parents are really strict with the Wi-Fi and I didn‚Äôt hear a response from her all night. That wasn‚Äôt unheard of. Anyways around 1 PM today she sends me this long winded, even for her, message about how she was disappointed to be talking about this with me again, and that we were back on the subject, and that she saw the message last night but didn‚Äôt want to respond. We‚Äôd been talking a lot about us the last week or so and learned a lot of new things about each other. We used to talk relationships a lot so I think she thought us not talking about them anymore turned over a new leaf in our friendship. But that just pissed me off. I hadn‚Äôt talked about her in over two weeks. During then, she talked about E at least twice at length. I used to talk about A a lot when I had a crush on her. I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt fun for her. But if I happen to bring her up one more time, like I said, it‚Äôd been weeks since I even mentioned her name, she can try to talk to me and help me. It just pisses me off a lot. It‚Äôs not much to ask that you support me if I might miss my ex once in a couple weeks. And she‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs said on multiple occasions that you can never talk about relationships, or someone you love, too much and that it‚Äôs normal. I understand this is an ex, but it‚Äôs the same shit. She did offer me some half assed advice, but it pissed me off so bad. She‚Äôs started being really short with me the last few hours and I‚Äôve been trying to take her side, because I know, I used to talk about her a lot, but it won‚Äôt kill you to help me just one more time. I know it sounds selfish that I‚Äôm expecting sympathy from her at all, because she doesn‚Äôt owe it, but I feel like she‚Äôs shutting me out for the wrong reasons. I let it go. I tried to steer the conversation to something she liked more, and I don‚Äôt want to sound demanding, because I liked talking about that too. But I can dare to bring up my ex if something happens.

Before, my neighbor asked me to go with her to run an errand, so I did and then I had a panic attack as soon as I got home because I made such an idiot of myself trying to engage in conversation with her and not being able to form coherent sentences.

346751,"how to deal with intense self-loathing?I dislike myself because I'm a bad person. I lie, cheat, and steal from friends and family. Basically 0 friends left at this point, for those reasons. Family still cares and feels obligated, wrongly, in my view. I massively screwed up a series of meaningful relationships for no particular reason other than I'm selfish and stupid when it comes to those things. One in particular haunts me in my dreams nearly every night. I justify all this by telling myself I'm really a genius and it will all be worth it in the end, but deep down I know that's just narcissism, and that in itself is very fucked up, the idea that it's okay to screw people who care about you because you're better than them.

So what to do? I don't want to hurt my family, but it seems that I can't help it - and is one massive dose of hurt really that much worse than a lifetime of it being doled out gradually? I think I'm a natural manipulator, liar, and kleptomaniac. I'm sure I have psychopathic tendencies, with how easily I manage what should be guilty feelings - although I know I'm not a full-blown psychopath, because I can be very emotional. Therapy has been totally unproductive - I often lie to therapists out of shame, and I've had little success implementing the advice they give me. I've been on a wide variety of meds but they haven't helped, and I tend to go off them because of the flat affect. Weed seems to help a little with everything, but I also have an addictive personality and it gradually takes over my life, which I don't enjoy and can't afford. Drinking doesn't help with much at all, but I can't help myself.

I don't see much of a future for me - I am mostly unemployable at this point, due to a massive gap in my work history and no good references. That said, even if I could find decent work, I've proven time and time again I can't hang onto it, mostly due to laziness. I'm also deeply pessimistic about the state of the world in general.

I do disagree when it's said that suicide is mostly about anger towards other people, or that people who commit it are terribly selfish - I think they underestimate the level of self-hatred going on, and how difficult it is to live with that.

So what to do if your actions show that you're a horrible person? There's no question in my case, believe me. I had a lot of advantages in life and I've managed to screw them all and spite the people who gave them to me, and I show no sign of stopping. Really, if you got to know me and tried to help me and be my friend, the whole time I'd be thinking about how to screw you over. And yeah, I don't feel like it's worth living, being like that.",suicide

346754,"Life is gradually losing it's meaning.Hi, I just want to talk about what's bothering me. I have all my life been that nerdy kid who was a bit weird. I am shy and extroverted at the same time, but I have always had friends. I was the science kid and had great ambitions about my future and I am musical too. I never did anything wrong and did really good in school. I never did well with the girls though. That was kind of sad, but I got over my crushes. I wasn't very popular either. Then I went on to what in my country is equivalent to high school (15/16-18/19yrs). I began studying the general subjects along with physics, chemistry and math. I really got into science and its way of thinking and I grew on that. But my self-esteem has always been low. I am very self-conscious about my appearance. I've had moderate acne since I was about 13 and am now 19. I've tried many kinds of methods and medications, but nothing worked. I am a very emotional person and tend to fall pretty hard when I fall. After I had my heart broken by the most perfect girl (yea I know, clich√©), things started to go downhill. I was 16 then. After that I got very focused on the meaning of life. From the scientific perspective I saw life as meaningless. We're here because universe is infinite and infinite possibilities ensures our existence. After we're dead everything we've lived for and done doesn't matter anymore. I got into that way of thinking. And then the inevitable happened: I hit the wall. I could no longer go through school with ease and without any work ethics. I began doing worse and worse in maths and physics. I felt like I was gradually losing my identity. My once so clear university plans seem to fade and I don't know who I am anymore. And of course the clich√© of another girl had to happen. I am hopelessly in love again. I feel like I can't be the smart physics guy anymore, but I can't be a normal person either cus I can't get a girl and have lost interest in most things. Now there is one semester left before high school is over and I feel like I'm falling apart.

346768,"The sacred texts: How to talk to girls/How to get a girlfriend #  Introduction

Hello boys, welcome, you probably clicked on this post because of the title, but first we gotta set some things straight.

This is, by no means, a step-by-step guide on how to get a girl to like you/have a date, or some infallible rulebook of how to interact with someone you like, this is just a compilation of the knowledge I've gained through experience, investigation and good advice from other people that I think a lot of you need and would like to know.

And before you go on all reddit-detective on me, yes, this is a fairly new account, yes, you have no reason or obligation to believe me, do what you want with the things I say and the information contained in this post. I just recently discovered this subreddit and found out a lot of you feel insecure and would like help or advice in the seemingly impossible task of interacting with the mythical creatures we only hear about in whispers known as ""females"".

This post was inspired by another post in this same subreddit asking this question, and realized I could make a better, in depth guide about the topic and open discussion about the advice I want to share with you, this will be a **very long post**, but I do recommend you try reading it in it's entirety, with this out of the way, lets start.

# OK then?

Remember: girls are, like us (maybe) human beings, and everyone has a unique way of thinking, feeling, has different opinions, tastes and characteristics, meaning that if something works on a girl, there is no certainty it will work with other girls, so I pretend this to be a comprehensive general advice or guide to help you talk with a girl in a comfortable and more effective manner.

# Hygene

Girls smell you before they see you, seriously, a lot of girls i've talked to about the topic say the same, if they catch a whiff of a nice smellin' guy, they inmediatly turn their heads, so having general good hygene is a **must** in being likeable to a girl:

* **Shower or bath regularly**: you don't have to be Mr. Clean, but please keep yourself not-dirty.
* **Use deodorant**: if possible, a good brand roll on antiperspirant, those aerosols commercials look tempting, but not only you're damaging the environment, they are generally less effective than using a good roll on antipersiprant where it matters and using cologne or perfume for the rest, but DON'T overdo it. Another no-no is thinking you can skip a bath by just putting on some cologne, **N O** believe me, it is worse to be sweaty or smelly and trying to cover it up with some body spray.
* **Cut your nails**: having long nails is DISGUSTANG, as much as it is a useful tool in some cases, trim and clean them regularly, having long nails is a negative on the list, especially if they are dirty.
* **Skin care is great**: Keeping your face and skin clean and soft is something a lot of girls like, would you rather hug a soft satin pillow or a coarse wool one?, regarding facial hair, this is a bit more divided, some girls like beard as a sign of masculinity, others like clean faces, so i'd just advice you to do whatever you are comfortable with, if you like you, I like you.
* **Brush your teeth**: Having bad breath is a major turn down, brush your teeth regularly to keep them clean, floss and mouthwash, not only because of your health, but having a clean mouth is important, you don't approach a girl with morning breath or a strand of meat hanging out between your teeth, it is not a bad idea to keep a breath freshener with you just in case, but it is not by any means a replacement for oral hygene.
* **Clean your ears and nose**: If, like me, you produce an insane amount of earwax, clean it out, ***DON'T PUT Q-TIPS IN YOUR INNER EAR***, those are meant to clean the outside of the ear, if you have internal earwax problems, consult your doctor or otorinloca- otorhinolacri- ot- you know what I mean. Blow your nose and wash it if necessary, having a booger or a earwax clump visible in broad daylight is simply put **BAD.**

# Behavioral advice

Knowing how to behave and think is important, so take into consideration the following points:

* **Relax**: It is easy to get nervous and start talking incoherently, babbling and stuttering. You must remember that girls are human beings, like you they have goals, feelings, preferences etc. they are also capable of being comprehensive and empathic, if you overanalyze and start thinking ""I'm gonna f\*ck up"" ""I can't do this"" ""Where do I even start"" you'll start spiraling out of control into embarassment or just freezing in panic. Be chill about it and try to have a little more confidence in yourself, everyone makes mistakes, so if you are calm about it, and don't give too much importance to something that doesn't have it, chances are, she won't either, maybe you can even get a laugh out of it. Breathe in and out, you don't need to learn a new language to talk to a girl (unless that girl does actually speak in some other language, duh).
* **Don't be afraid**: She won't bite... I hope... but seriously, the thing is, a lot of you fear rejection, you don't want your friends to watch you fail or fear the embarassment that comes from it, and even if a girl rejects you or just plain avoids contact with you, the downsides are nothing in comparison to the possible reward, and sometimes, even if you don't get a date, you'll make a friend!
* **Be casual**: If it is the first or one of the first times you talk to your ""objective"" chances are, you don't know each other, find out what she likes, ask simple and non-agressive questions. You shouldn't talk about your impressive collection of videogames or the lore of your favorite anime in the first date or interaction, keep things simple and casual, if you talk about complicated stuff, or act like ""i'm here for you, tell me anything"" you'll be uninteresting or you will end up on the friendzone (dun-dun-dun).
* **Be polite**: It sounds like something you are taught when you were a child, but it's true, most girls dislike mean or foul-mouthed men, be polite and use a basic brain to mouth ""filter"", be chivalrous and respectful, thee needn't to talk in old english, but be careful as to what comes out of your mouth.
* **Be sincere:** Sincerity is impressive for girls, makes it easier for them to trust you, this is both good for talking to girls and to mantain a relationship, you don't need to tell her what you do when you're home alone at 2 am in your bedroom, but being sincere when she makes you a question is certainly attractive.
* **Be yourself**: It sounds like a clich√© but *to be yourself is all that you can do,* talking to girls really isn't complicated, and it's better to have a girl like you the way you are, than by the way you appear to be, if you deviate too much from the ""real you"" you are decieving her, and like with false advertising, it ends in dissapointment.
* **You are top priority:** we've all seen the ""simp"" memes, and if one thing we can learn from them is: you need to care for you, you need to love yourself before starting to love someone else, accept who you are, work on your self esteem and care, if you feel down talk to a friend or someone you trust, work on loving you for who you are, if you have depression or feel unwilling to try and better yourself up, talk with a professional, mental health is just as important as physical health, and sometimes you need to stop and think, if you are doing more for someone else than for yourself.

# What do THEY like?

There is no unequivocal definition as to what a girl likes, but in general there are somethings that are pleasant to girls:

* **Good hygene**: as seen at the start of the post.
* **Chivalry**: it's not dead, it's just different, be polite and nice towards girls, complimenting how they look or dress is fine, this is not ""simping"", it's just being more attractive, but it does not entitle you to the love or praise of a girl.
* **Be natural**: don't be robotic or talk in a scripted way, chill, and let the words flow, if you make a mistake, as pointed out before, it's not the end of the world, maybe you can even get a laugh about it, lighten the mood, and be yourself.
* **Good posture**: don't go walking like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, try to walk straight, head on and lean foward! walking curved down is body language for insecurity, cowardice and fear, which is definetly not attractive. Adding to it, when in a conversation, leaning ever so slightly foward makes you look more invigorated and interesting, slouching and leaning back has the opposite effect.
* **Smile**: Smiling is scientifically proven to make you look and be happier, you'll transmit a happier and more confident and comforting aura, making it easier for women to connect with you, it makes you look more attractive and likeable. If you feel insecure about your smile or teeth, or have medical issues with them, consult a professional.
* **Look her in the eyes**: Very important, makes you look interested and confident, you seem to be more trustworthy and easy to talk with, talking with someone that doesn't look you in the eyes is not only rude, it transmits disinterest and makes you look feel bored.
* **Be healthy**: some studies and polls show girls don't really look for super buff, he-man like men, and being a little bit overweight isn't unattractive, but y'know, working out, eating good, and getting in good shape is a plus for most girls.

# Read the signs!

Unfortunately, females are weird creatures, they rely much more on body language and hints to show interest or disinterest, so you must pay attention to how they move and feel around you.

**If a girl:**

* Smiles
* Leans towards you (if sitting together, feet or knees pointed towards you)
* Opens their eyes a bit more widely
* Looks slighly down (or up towards you with their heads down)
* Plays with their hair while talking to you
* Breathes slightly or comfortably
* Nods when you say something
* You both breathe or walk in a syncronized fashion (accidentally)

They are most likely attracted or interested in you.

**If a girl:**

* Constantly checks the time
* Leans away or turns her back on you
* Breathes heavily
* Looks uncomfortable
* Looks everywhere except towards you in a fast pace

Chances are, she wants you away from her proximity ASAP

**BEWARE**: be discrete, remember these are assumptions, don't take these signs too seriously as we as men, have more difficulties understanding and observating body language, so we are prone to misinterpeting things.

# DOs and DON'Ts

Some of these might sound a bit ""simp"" like or old fashioned but believe me, some chivalry doesn't hurt, something else that doesn't hurts is knowing what you shouldn't do:

**DON'T**

* Scratch your private parts, simply put: disgusting, if you absolutely need to, go to the bathroom. If a girl is reading this guide, which I doubt, consider that our package sometimes is quite difficult to deal with, things down there often get, against our will: ""stiff"", ""sticky"" and ""itchy"", not to mention, our gonads fall right in between our thighs, so sitting comfortably does take more space for a man than for a woman (this is no excuse for excessive manspreading, respect other's personal space), not to mention that it sometimes makes walking hard (in more than one way), because of things falling out of place down there.
* Be stingy, pay the bill, and if you can, leave tips, if you act greedy and very stingy, they will be less likely to consider a relationship with you.
* Be your mommy's child, please just don't, you're not 7 years old, and calling your mom ""mommy"" and/or relying too much on her is a sign of poor independence which is a no-no in the girl's books.
* Take a lengthy phone call that interrupts your conversation, this will make her feel not interesting and will make her bored.
* Let your palms sweat, if you have naturally sweaty hands, you can use some talc or baking soda to reduce moisture in your hands, grabbing a sweaty hand is by all accounts, gross.
* Look at her cleavage, a quick glance doesn't hurt, hell, you might not be aware that girls also do look at our... qualities... (they look at our butts, our ""stuff"" and, in some cases, abdominal and chest area) but if you're talking to her DO NOT stare at the incorrect eyes, it is disrespectful and mean.
* Talk about your geeks (or heavy/boring/serious topics) in a detailed manner, it is not wrong to say you like X thing or consume X content, but unless the girl is into the topic, don't talk about the lore of Neon Genesis Evangelion, or a generally considered weird taste or kink unless you already trust one another.
* Talk about your ex(es). Especially in a disrespectful manner, apart from being a depressing or party bummer topic, they will think that if they become your ex, you will also talk dirt on them when you break up.
* Drag a friend to a date, if you want to talk to a girl, do it alone, and if you asked her out on a date, don't bring someone else, it's supposed to be just for you two, having a third wheel is uncomfortable and is, in some ways, a breach to the privacy girls look when dating a guy.

**DOs**

* Try to make her laugh, *it's a simple spell but quite unbreakable*, if you can make a girl laugh with ease, you have practically already won the game, girls love guys that make them laugh, it just happens to be that way. Do remember, humor works differently with girls, don't be mean, rude or insensitive.
* Learn to dance, or if you have a nice voice, to sing: most girls like dancing, and men with good moves are a rare catch, so knowing how to move it is quite useful, especially if you live somewhere where dancing music is prominent. Singing is also a powerful weapon, if you have a nice voice, learning how to sing a song, if you can nicely sing a girl's favorite song, she'll be prone to falling in love with you, why do you think serenades have been the ultimate courtship tool of men for centuries now?
* Gift her stuff, gifting is an art, it makes you look attentive and caring, qualities females look in their partners, and makes you automatically more attractive, especially if you gift her something she likes or is fond of, if you know a girl likes, say ducks, gift her a duck plushie or something related to what she likes, this is bound to be more impactful than something expensive but uninteresting to her.
* Show interest in her topics, people like talking about what they like, this especially applies to girls, they like men who can listen, if you find out about something she likes, try to ask her or talk with her about it, she will feel comfortable talking about it, and by extent, comfortable talking with you.

# Ze End

This is the end of the ""sacred texts"", feel free to discuss or critique advice or information here contained, the objective of this post was to help some guys feel more confident and be a bit more ready to talk to girls.

It is not easy, no one is born knowing, and remember, this guide doesn't guarantee you will be able to hook up with any girl you see, but knowing these tricks and guidelines is a good headstart in the correct direction.

346793,"I've drank more this week than I have in the last two years combinedNot sure why I'm posting this but I'd appreciate any perspective, advice, or encouragement you can give. (26 M, for context.)

I've struggled with loneliness and low self-esteem for years and actually managed to make noticeable improvements in how I treat myself recently. It felt like a major turning point in my life, but that hasn't born out at all and everything just keeps getting worse. I used my newfound confidence to finally try dating apps but I haven't had any success. My only two friends just broke up with each other a few weeks ago and now neither of them talk to me anymore. I have no idea how to meet new people and make friends, especially during a pandemic. I'm bored and lonely every night and have started to drink by myself just to pass the time; something I have done maybe once or twice ever before this week. My job is frustrating and stressful and I only stay because it pays well but now I wonder what the point even is if I'll never have a mortgage or a family to take care of anyway.

I don't think I have a chemical imbalance and I'm not determined to wallow in how bad I feel. I know most of the people on here have it way worse than I do and I know I can be happy when there are people in my life who care about me and like spending time with me. I just legitimately cannot think of ways to solve these problems and it scares me to think that I'll have to face life alone for decades on end. I'm not sure how long I can last.",suicide
346795,"Looking for a reason to go onI've juggled the idea around in my head for a long time but never have I been so close to actually ending it. It started back when I was in high school. Sophomore year I was diagnosed with depression but for reasons unbeknownst to me I wasn't able to take any sort of medication. The first couple of years the thought occasionally popped into my head but I dismissed it as just part of being an ""angsty teen"".

Senior year was different for me, though. It was college admissions time and I was looking to enroll at the honors program at my stage college, so I needed an edge that made me seem better than the standard applicant. That's when my parents revealed that I was diagnosed as autistic (Asperger's syndrome to be more specific). I was actually diagnosed as a kid and they did everything they could to make sure that I could try and live a normal life, and for elementary school I felt like I was just a kid, no mental disorders or anything despite a few odd quirks I had. Once high school rolled around that all changed as I found it increasingly harder to socialize and ""fit in"", finding that some of my ""quirks"" became a lot more amplified and prominent than I remember them being and finding that I had a genuine fear and inability of being social outside of my comfort zone. The more I thought about it the more a lot of my earlier life made sense, and the more I started to hate myself and see myself as some sort of mistake or genetic freak. I feel like I should be counting myself lucky that I was part of the ""fortunate few"" who are diagnosed with autism and actually have some sort of intellectual ""benefit"", but there are still too many drawbacks to this curse to even make me consider myself lucky. With the combination of depression and autism (and with it the increased self-loathing) I felt myself much closer to the edge than ever before, but I still found some happiness in the world and had a few reasons to keep moving on, so I powered through until college.

At this point things weren't great for me, but they could have been worse. Due to my ""condition"" I had unintentionally pushed away a lot of my friends before-hand and the few I had were usually preoccupied with their own lives, so when it came to college I was on my own for the most part. I tried my best to make new friends and actually made a couple (although I feel like they all just stayed around me because they knew something was wrong with me and they felt bad). I also had 3 ""motivators"" that kept me going when things got rough: video games, alcohol (something I had recently discovered) and a dog that I had loved since childhood. The year started off fine, classes weren't too hard and I was actually enjoying myself for awhile, where any sort of ""bad thoughts"" seldom drifted through my mind. 

Mid year though, things took a drastic turn for the worst. When I was visiting home one weekend I woke up to my parents telling me that my dog had to be put down last night and they didn't want to wake me beforehand. I was absolutely devestated. I had never really dealt with death beforehand so to know that my favorite pet was just gone, with no chance to say any goodbyes crushed me. After that things got worse to me. I turned to my other two ""vices"" to try and get my mind off of things (at this point my dog dying was only one of many concerns, including some of my ""friends"" trading me out for the latest model as well as failing my first class) so I started drinking more heavily and playing more games, which in turn hurt school more. At one point my friends cut me off of the sauce, not out of concern but because I ""wasn't worth it"" to supply anymore, so now I was down to games. Things kept getting worse, home life became much more tense, and I felt my friends slowly dropping off one by one. 

Two things happened this week that finally pushed me past my breaking point. I played one game in particular (Runescape) that I poured most of my time into for the past few years. With a double xp weekend, I was actually happy to get on and have some fun. I got on last night to find that my account was banned because of a supposed ""bot"" (I never used a bot in my life, it was never worth the risk) and that there was no way for my account to be recovered. Everything that I had worked so hard for was just gone in an instant, and I had lost my last escape from reality. The other thing was a realization that had just occurred to me. My high school dating life was practically nonexistent, and my knowledge of my ""condition"" only made things harder in college. Any attempts I made for any sort of relationship were either met with brutal rejections or unenthusiastic ""No""s. One of the only things I really wanted in life was some sort of relationship, someone else who really cared about me. Valentine's Day week (and all the happy couples making their happiness as obvious as possible) made me feel like I'm going to be forced to live the rest of my life alone and die the same way.

I can't take it anymore. I feel like an outcast and a freak who will never know what it's like to feel love or any sort of happiness. I feel like my mind is continuously slipping and my mental state is only getting worse. I can't find enough happy moments in my life to outweigh all the lows. I feel like I have nothing left for me to live for, and the only reason I haven't gone ahead and pulled the trigger is because I know how devastated the few people who care about me would feel. I just need some reason, any sort of reason or motivation to keep living.",suicide

   I live with extreme physical pain and overwhelming emotional pain everyday. My problem is, knowing I cannot depart, is depressing me even more! I love my kids so much, I will bear this pain every day of my life, but then some days, I start to convince myself that they would be better off without me, I know that's irrational thinking and push it aside but it still niggles. 
    Now my husband is being a childish needy jerk and its not helping my irrational thinking. 
   I feel so lost &amp; alone.",suicide
346798,"I don't want to live like this but dying is scaryThis is hard to write but lately life has seen hopeless, everything that made me happy is gone.  I had been with my dream girlfriend for a few years, the kind of girl I had always dreamed of being with, until we got in an argument and she decided she didn't want to try to talk out our problems and just leave.  She left me right before Christmas over text, and got with another person on my birthday (new years).  She was my reason to live and work hard, my greatest fantasy and motivator I would think of when trying to push myself to succeed was the thought of the two of us starting a family in the future.  I don't have that dream anymore, so I feel like I have nothing to live for.  It's hard imagining being with another person, and instead of recovering a little each day I think more and more about just ending it.  


What doesn't help is that I live alone at my University, and while I have friends I don't see them much (despite them knowing of my situation) due to their heavy academic workloads and fraternity obligations.  It's very difficult to reach out to other people as well because of the Greek dominated social climate on my campus, sure there are some clubs but they met rather infrequently and only emcompass a small variety of interests (though I have joined some of the ones I can).  I try to go to bars alone but most people don't entertain meaningful conversations with total strangers, so the best form of interaction I get regularly is playing VR Chat and trying to make friends on that.  I see the parties and events my friends go to...  And I would do just about anything to be able to have fun like them.  But I'm a Junior and don't come from money, so joining a fraternity isn't a realistic option.


I haven't been to class all week and stopped working out, I hope to try and start again though.  I don't have much of an appetite and things just aren't fun anymore...  All I can think about is her and how I wish I could have just one more day having her to keep me company and help my hurt.  I relied on her for everything because I believed her when she said she wouldn't leave...  Honestly one of the only things keeping me going is the thought she might come back, because she herself said she could see us being together again in the future.  I also try to think about how sad I was when my friend killed himself in his childhood, the new video games and music I'd miss out on, all of that...  Also that maybe one day I will have a family and a loving wife like I've dreamed.  I just feel so trapped like I've died already, like I'm walking down death row or something.  I just wish something good would happen, that someone would really show they care... I know people would be sad if I died, but I wish someone would message me asking how my day was, or something like that.  I just hate living this lonely life and having to live without the one thing that made me happy.  It gets me down how I get no sincere matches on Tinder and no replies on OKCupid, I don't feel unloveable but I'm kinda slipping back into hating myself and feeling hopeless...",suicide

I'm a senior in highschool (17m) and every morning is a struggle. My thought process is the same every morning. First it's a fight to leave bed. Then I'm contemplating if I should shower or not. Finally when I get out of bed I keep thinking ""If I just make myself throw up I won't need to go to school, I can just take a swig of hydrogen peroxide and puke my guts out."" I finally end up taking a shower then sit on the toilet for 20 minutes hoping I suddenly get sick so I can avoid people. I hate talking to people. I'm a listener and an introvert. 

I'm all over the fucking place guys. On my gravel road I'm not a safe driver. I don't really care what happens. I crash I crash oh well. I've slid off the road several times but no serious impacts yet. I constantly think ""it's a straight stretch I can easily hit 90+ mph and hit a tree."" 

My depersonalization is getting bad again. I thought it was gone but I guess not. My best friend says it's probably caused by my brother. She also thinks that's the reason I'm so cool headed and hate arguments and try to deescalate other people's arguments. 

People say I'm the kindest person they've ever met. I can never be mad at anyone longer than 10 minutes (except myself) and there's no one I dislike even if they're a total dick to me. I just don't have the need or energy to dislike someone. There's no point and it just causes trouble. I've grown up with ""treat others how you want to be treated"" and I've taken it to heart. That's how I've lived most of my life. I go out of my way to help others just because helping others helps me get my own stuff done. For example I never do my homework but when someone asks help on there's I'll gladly help then I have a boost to do my own. 

*Here's the main point of this post* 

I'm suicidal. I have been for 3 years now. I'm supposed to be writing an essay (descriptive) that's due tomorrow and I took a friend's aderall to help me focus (I have adhd but my doctor can't prescribe aderall or vyvanse) and I am focussed just not on my essay. My family life is fucking shit. I'm sure there are people with worse lives and I shouldn't complain but well here I am. I'm adopted. I was at an infant. My adoptive parents I have no connection with. They don't know who I am. They don't know what I like. I just feel like I'm living in their house. There's no love just presence. My brother is a nut (not bio). He has severe anger issues and a cause of many of my problems I think. When I think about home I shake so badly and I get into a depersonalization episode. He's 8 months younger than me. I'm afraid to sleep when he's awake. In the past he's woken me by beating me with a bat or by throwing a rolling chair at me. We've gotten into fist fights. He's put blades to my neck repeatedly like swords or knives. Every single time he did that I screamed at him ""Fucking do it you godamn pussy, I know you don't have the balls to do it"" and he'd drop the knife and run crying. I caught him dragging my sister (not bio) by the shirt and hitting her. I lost it and slammed him to the wall and punched him until my knuckles bled. He ran downstairs crying and I sat on my bed trying to fight back tears. He came back with a shotgun. I stood up looked him in the eyes and walked to him. He put it to my head tears streaming down his face ""I'm going to put a fucking slug into your head and feed you to the dogs if you touch me one more time"" I turned around and said ""Do it"". I hate this place so fucking much. CPS can't do anything idk why but they've tried. I have a scar on my arm from where he pulled a knife and cut me. 

I'm done with my rant. If you read it all thanks and if you send a message or comment even bigger thanks. If not oh well. At least you didn't waste time reading it.

I watched each video and sometimes rewatch them to feel less alone. I love his videos. He says something I personally don't understand. He said he didn't hate life, and that life wasn't boring. He said that if he didn't have depression and chronic pain, he would hope to enjoy life. I have chronic illness and depression and anxiety. I don't enjoy life. I think it's boring. Mundane. Empty. I feel empty all of the time. I feel disconnected from my life and reality. I have no goals and aspirations except dying. I hate work and school. 

He said even if he didn't have depression, he still wouldn't want to live with the chronic illness. And he said if he didn't have the chronic illness, he still wouldn't want to live with the depression. It's a poor quality of life. I could relate to this so much. I don't want to live with either.

It‚Äôs hard to pick a starting point for this post, considering my long history of failing in absolutely everything. But right now I think I‚Äôm at my breaking point. I just transferred this semester to a new school, and I‚Äôm having a terrible time. My car battery died last night, and I have no friends who can help me. I‚Äôm probably going to fail 3 out of 4 classes, and if I can‚Äôt finish this 5 page paper (which I don‚Äôt even know how to start, and I‚Äôve never written anything more than 3 pages) I‚Äôm going to fail all 4. This isn‚Äôt my first time failing out of college either, I flunked out in 2016 when I was 18, and I failed a semester of community college last spring. And academics aren‚Äôt even the worst part of my life. I‚Äôve made no friends in school, and my only 2 friends from back home are 5 hours away from me. I‚Äôm feeling so disoriented right now so I‚Äôm sorry if this is disorganized. I feel like I have no future and my life sucks. I‚Äôm never going to graduate school, I‚Äôm never going to find love (I‚Äôm a gay 21 year old who‚Äôs never been in a relationship, or even a second date), I‚Äôm never going to get a job paying slightly above minimum wage, im never going to be able to afford to move out of my parents, and I‚Äôm never gonna be happy. What‚Äôs the point of going on if I know I‚Äôm going to be miserable? Every day is agony, and I‚Äôm an unlovable unbearably awkward ugly pathetic sad piece of shit. Wtf do I do?

346861,"I'm tired.Hi. This is hideously rambling. I'm sorry but I don't seem to be able to form a proper train here.

I guess I should say who I am roughly, I'm 32, Male, self-employed (its hard, so hard, but I am surviving and succeeding at it). Its hard to say exactly whats wrong, I guess its many things. I feel like I've been fighting against all flags my whole life. Everyone who I've ever loved has betrayed me at one point or another. My friends, my parents, and the woman I loved more than anything. 

My whole adult life I've had to be strong for others, my best friend (he betrayed me too, for a woman. I let him back in my life maybe 6-8 years ago, I recognized his genuine remorse)... my once fiance. Many people rely on me to help them because I always seem to have unlimited strength. I am always willing to help others, its my essential nature -- I cannot help it. I was strong so I helped the weak instinctively.

Years ago my best friends life was in shambles, he was sick, broke and lonely and no one seemed to care, except me. I helped him through it, he was close to suicide and I believe if I was not there he would have done it. We've always been a pair since we met in Grade 9 because our lives where unhappy, we did our best and fought for years back to back against all the truly awful shit that just kept happening to us. He did betray me, but he was remorseful -- but perhaps it was only because his relationship didn't work out in the end. I think that if his relationship with this woman did work, he would have never returned to be my friend again. 

My parents betrayal is really too personal to discuss. They both love me, and again, I forgave them for their actions because sometimes people just do not understand why what they are doing is wrong. Maybe they figured it out eventually, maybe not. Still, my Dad has been awesome to be for a long time now and I know he loves me very much. But he is.. a strange person who doesn't seem to understand emotional pain very well. I would swear he was an alien if I didn't know for a fact he has produced human offspring. He wants to help me but is simply incapable of understanding whats happening with me. He just cannot understanding that I'm finally crumbling, or why.

I met my ex three years ago through a work friend. She was my first real relationship at 29. Women do not seem to like me for some reason. I don't think I'm unattractive, but something about my personality maybe, I don't know or understand it. Love at first sight should be bullshit, but for me it just wasn't, it was real and she said she felt it too. She was bipolar, very bipolar. The fact that she was somehow broken was attractive to me because of my bizarre and insane need to protect those around me. It felt good to suffer through her bipolar fits of rage and depression because it felt like I was doing what I was meant to do. I felt that my strength was doing what it was meant to be doing, and although at times I was frustrated by her mood swings... she was so sweet and loving when she was normal which honestly was most of the time. We where so close and loving that my lifelong depression just vanished. It was like it was never there, and my past and nightmares .. where just not a problem. She got angry at me occasionally because I refused to discuss my past very much -- but she didn't really understand that all my life was horrible and that I didn't ever want to relive those events, that guilt and rage where the only things in my past and I was finally free of them. I don't think it was ever a factor though in the break up.

I've never been formally diagnosed with anything, but depression does run in my family (my grandmother has issues with that &amp; anxiety, my mom has admitted to me that she's struggled with depressive moods). I just find it horribly frustrating that.. my life is pretty great and while I often enjoy it, there are times like these that I find myself uninterested in continuing on.

I don't know what this'll achieve.. maybe I'll just feel better because I can't talk about it out loud. Maybe I just need someone to say it's okay that I feel this way and it doesn't make me a wuss because I haven't had big traumatic events or a family/friends that are anything but supportive.

346873,"Can't think of a title.I don't really know where to start.  I'm unemployed and I live with my mother.  A recent state of affairs.  I was recently hospitalized and my father visited me and told me to move my shit out.  He's pissed at me and I can't say I blame him.  He's been paying for my education but I fucked up.  Struck out.  It was my last chance to pursue the only dream I had left.  I'll never be able to afford to go back on my own.  My mother had been urging me to move back in with her for a while.  Said it would be better for me here, there would be people here for me to talk to.  She's full of shit.  She talks to me when it's convenient for her, any other time I try to talk to her she acts all put out about it, like conversation with me is a chore.  I don't mean to demonize my parents, my father least of all.  He's been good to me, I've just been consistently fucking up since I became ill in my senior year of high school.  He just got tired of it.  He wasted a lot of money on me.  My mother is just a martyr and a drama queen.

I can't talk to either of them.  My father is intimidating and thinks he's smarter than he really is.  Don't get me wrong, he's one of the smartest men I know, but he severely overestimates himself.  He's stubborn and presumptuous and seems to think that he knows exactly what I'm going through.  He seems to think that I should be able to will myself healthy and doesn't handle being told that he's wrong well at all.  In fact he tells me to leave the room any time I try to correct him on the matter.  It doesn't matter any more anyway, our relationship is essentially over.  I don't know what the deal is with my mother, every time I try to talk to her about shit she gives me generic advice and makes it about herself.  Whatever, I guess.

My girlfriend is exhausted and tired of my bullshit.  I've put her through a lot over the past seven or so years.  She's unhappy in this relationship.  She contributes to the relationship a lot more than I am able to and that's a shitty relationship to be in.  I have very little to offer her and she deserves a lot more.  She didn't handle my diagnosis very well.  Said a lot of shit that she shouldn't have, things that I'm not really comfortable repeating.  I've given her every chance to leave me but she says she doesn't want to.  I can't talk to her either.  She has plenty of shit of her own to worry about and has grown tired of listening to what I have to say.  I'm a bitter, angry, depressed, and irritable person and I guess it sort of gets exhausting to listen to after a while.  I have a few friends, band mates, but I really can't talk to them for the same reason.  We're pretty tight, we've been playing together for five or six years, but that's not enough to put up with the frustrated ramblings of a schizophrenic loser.

My mother, my girlfriend, and my band mates.  That's all I have left and I can't talk to a single one of them.  Not only that, most of them won't really respond to me if I'm talking about something that isn't particularly interesting to them.  My guitarist is probably my best friend and we are a lot alike so I don't really have that problem with him.  My drummer is just a good dude in general and will talk about anything as long as I'm not just dumping all of my bullshit on him.  Everyone else pretty much just ignores me if I try to talk to them about something.  My girlfriend does it a lot too and it kills me.  Like, I'll bring up something that I'd like to talk about and she'll respond, but she'll flat out ignore what I say and start talking about something that she wants to talk about.  I'm not interesting to her anymore.  I don't really have anyone who's just interested in what I have to say.

I reach out on the internet frequently just to have someone to talk to.  I join forums and websites according to my own interests and meet people who talk to me and think I'm interesting for a while, but it never lasts very long.  They get bored of me and eventually stop talking to me.  Every single time, and I've been at it for quite a while.  I just don't know how to maintain a friendship.  I've lost all of my social skills.

I'm alone with my thoughts and they're dangerous thoughts to have.  My medications have effectively gotten rid of the hallucinations but I still have episodes on a bimonthly basis.  It's a terrifying experience, one that I'm not sure how to explain.  It's disorienting and confusing.  It's suffocating me.

I'm having nightmares.  I dream of people who love and care about me, people who think I'm interesting and enjoy my company.  Then I wake up inside my dream and eventually fade back into feeling loved.  It happens over and over again and I eventually figure out that I'm dreaming when I wake up and I try to remember that it's only a dream when I fade back into feeling loved, but I never can.  The worst part is that I can never wake up.  It just keeps happening over and over, crushing me each and every time.

Apparently none of my medications have fatal consequences in overdose.  I suppose that's a good thing.  Maybe I'll try heroin lol.",suicide

346876,"Can't handle fucking anythingI don't even know why I'm on this sub, I used to go on it to comfort people nearly everyday but now it looks like the perspectives have changed. As the title suggests I can't handle anything right now, I am facing juvie, have semi alcoholic parents who I love but have mentally scarred me, have mental health issues (possible schizophrenia) and am in general a pretty horrible person. While writing that last sentence I realised those aren't only thing that I can't handle but also reasons to kill myself which I am coming a bit too close to. I have a plan for when things go south and well, things are starting to go south again. I have many problems but one of the most recent is when I accidentally ""stabbed"" a boy my age. I remember it so vividly, I walked up and down the school stairs searching for him, at sometime point took the knife out, saw him and then its all a blur. After the blur I remember taking back what he stole from me, turning back to shout ""next time you do that, I will put you in hospital"" and seeing his left Arm covered I'm red from the elbow to themed waist. I knew what I had done but I was too angry to think about consequences but that image is still burned into my minding I can't get it out.

After that I remember sitting in the schools mental health area which was a small room the size of a large elevator for about 4 hours having a complete mental breakdown. I caught my friends eye from the window and he looked so disappointed, apparently after talking to him he thought had gone insane which I kind of had. When waiting outside the school for the taxi to pick me and mum up, the schools football team started to come out, most of which contained people in my year and my close friends who gave me a look of worry and empathy that almost makes me cry. I heard murmurs as the people I didn't know so well started looking at me because apparently when you stab someone, new travels real fast.

I have a question for anybody who might be reading this. Have you ever have 6 articles written that were about how you stabbed someone or have you ever been searched for weapons twice or ever been asked if you have school officials question you if you have secret pockets for concealing weapons or have you ever been held back from break in school for a week just incase you hurt the boy you stabbed again or ever been treated like a psychopath. Ever had your friends phone you up saying that the cops were just asking him about you and one last thing, have you ever been accused of being a rightwing nazi and thrown of school because if you have not then let me tell you something, all of that shit together affects and stays with a person forever and its not nice at all. it makes a person feel helpless because you are treated as the kid who stabbed someone by teachers and staff. 

I am a horrible person if you can't tell. I am manipulative, a thief, violent, abusive to my mothers because she drinks, hate the person I stabbed more than before I stabbed them and burden my friends with suicidal thoughts when I try to open up. I have caused so much pain to my family that they have to stop working and stop making money. I rely heavily on my friends which I shouldn't because they will probably cut of contact with me after a while.

Before you say ""think of your friends and loved ones"" just remember  I'm selfish and if I really want to kill myself I would only think of them for a split second because after having learned the hard way, everything has consequences and you can not stop that. anyway thanks for reading, it would be nice to talk to someone who isn't drunk because those are the only people I can talk too at the moment.",suicide

""also, don't think will post my art anymore.""

what I meant was if she thinks her art was screwed up, mines is definitely way more screwed. She got what I meant, I confirmed it. But she hates what I say and said it makes her feel guilty. I'm so sorry. I really shouldn't have said what I said. She hasn't forgive me and I feel very bad about it. I guess I lost my best friend, and the only friend I could share everything with. 

when I said I don't think I'll post my art anymore, it actually isn't related to anything I've said before or after.

346913,"I had a suicide plan and I need help in a new oneSo I had a suicide plan, I had money saved for a roadtrip and then I'd suicide far away from home because I didn't want to fuck up my brother if he is the one to find me dead. Not a lot of money because I am an artist, so it was just sufficient to die in style (yeah Im this stupid and that's why I wanna die in the first place).

Anyway, I spent all my money moving from my hometown, trying a last time for a new job and life. I got this amazing experience, but I guess it is going to nowhere. Also I am so pathetic, I fell in love with my boss (stupid af but not surprised because I am pathetic) - it never happened before,  I already have a long-term relationship but I am super duper faithful and will never cheat on my bf, even if we are fighting and stuff since october. To be fair my bf started being impotent, and lost interest in me.. And even if he denies it, I am pretty sure his problems only exists because of me, but he is so accommodated with his whole life (he makes a lot of money still live with his parents) that he doesn't want to think about it, about our problems. Every time we talk feels like I'm wasting his time with my boredomness (which may be true I guess).. 

Anyway I am so so soo needy that I felt in love with my boss because he was trully interested in me (but not in a lover way, only professionally).

I am only explaining this because I am like this, but I was a suicidal before, I tried with 15, and now 11 years later my life is not solved. I'm not planning on suicide because my BF or my boss, it is because I can't take more shit from life. I would accept marrying my bf who clearly doesn't love me anymore just not to be alone, but that changes everything and also he doesn't deserve this. I don't wanna fuck up more people.

As I said, I had all this thing planned before leaving to the new job, and things are getting more and more complicated, and I am really tired of living.

My family also never cares for what I'm doing or wanting to do, they just call me to talk about their own problems. It is not like they care if I die or not. My dad passed away in my birthday long time ago, and I am sure they can deal with my death. My mom only worries about money and she is helping me right now. So.

Anyway, I just want an opinion. I will wait till my next birthday (I'm kind of a romantic, so I want it to end the day it began). I'm so tired to hear about god, god never made anything for me.

I was always a fucking nerd and aside for the time I was bullied in school, I loved and lived to learn. I'm super responsible and have no debts and nothing to care about. The bank keep offering money to me, and as I am kind of needy now, I'm thinking to accept, make my roadtrip and die in style. But my morals are screaming inside me, I really don't want to leave debts to my family. I wanna die as if I was a bad dream inside everyone's head, because that's what I feel I am from the very last day I was born. Do you have any tips for dying without pain? I don't have a car, a gun or an oven. I can get methane, it is pretty easy here where I live. Pills are off topic because I'm not the one people would say is a suicidal, I'm also a hell of an actor, so I'm looking forward to die in cheap and painless ways. If I can't achieve it, I will sure go for the loan in the bank and then will be my family's problem to pay for it.. 

Disclaimer: The funny thing is, nobody have a clue that I'm dying inside, because I'm usually that funny friend. So if you really like this person of your group, pay attention. 
Also I don't want help and anything.. I can't take it anymore, and I also can't talk to anyone, everybody seem so tired of my fucking drama (even me ahaha).

Two people she knew from her family's place of religion messaged her about it. The effect was worse than imaginable. She feels embarrassed, destroyed. Said she felt like she ruined her family's life and so on. I tried to console her over phone. I really did. I thought it worked but I was wrong. 

To make things harder, we've been in a hidden relationship for some time because of her family and how they would react. On top of this, I moved for work to the midwest \(she is on the west coast\). I feel useless from here.

She called me from a hospital yesterday to tell me what had happened and that she was brought in before she could make her attempt jumping off a bridge. I have limited contact with her. She doesn't want her family to find out about us.  Right now her sister and another friend are the ones who know of her condition and no one else. She's on a 72 Psych hour hold by the hospital.

I want to be there for her. I can't do anything from here. She told me not to go over there because it will make matters worse. Please, please advise me. I feel like I'm loosing her and I really just want her to be happy and healthy before anything.

What can I do from here. What should I do? Will they really release her after 72 hours?

Happy and like others

Now what's even worse is that I was in my bra and undies because that is how I always sleep and he was shirtless so my mom thinks I'm a sleeping around and that I am a ho. My mom made him write his contact info and address down but he gave a fake number, name, and address. She then forced him out. After he left she came to my room and started hitting me and crying. She said "" what happened to you? How many times have I told you?"" I didn't understand what she meant but how many times have I told you because she doesn't tell me anything. And then she left. She came back later and told me that she tried calling and everything was fake. She asked for him number but I didn't say anything, I don't want him to get in trouble. She proceeded to question ""what happened to my princess"" and say things like ""it's ok to have friends, but not friends like this."" And then brought up my grades which I don't understand why she did. And I talked back and said that it was her fault I'm failing math because she forced me to take a class that I knew I couldn't handle but still forced me anyways. We started to yell at eat other. Also, Whenever I get a bad test score she tells me she's disappointed in me and that I focus too much with my friends. The thing is, I don't even hangout with them other then at school. She even locked me at home during thanksgiving break. I skype or FaceTime them occasionally. She always tells me that school is more important than friends which in a sense is true, but I find my friends comforting, they are like my family. My relationship with my mom is bad. We always end up fighting. I never really wanted to try to talk to her. She always calls me a disappointment. She triggers my desperation. Since last year, I have had suicidal thoughts. It has been better because my bf and my friends make me happy. However, this incident and what my mom has done/ said to me, has triggered my suicidal thoughts. I have been researching. I thought about cutting but I'll have to cut through a lot and really deep. I thought about hanging but I don't have anything to hang myself with. I also thought about overdosing and I think I will. Getting back to my story, I don't know why she is so against me having a boyfriend. I would never lose my virginity in high school. And my boyfriend knows that. He treats me really well and my friends approve of him. My mom also found out his name and #, prob from calling my phone provider. She even called my best friend and talked to her. 
At this point, she'll probably call the school and ask for his parents numbers and talk to them. I hope my bf is okay and I don't him to get her because this is my fault that this had to happen this way.

I have a confession to make to you it is from the heart. And it's the last thing I want. And I feel very selfish.
All this has me in a state of confusion and guilt.
On the one hand I feel useless and selfish because being aware of what I have I can not repair. And you think that my ""problem"" or ""condition"" has no qualms. And I know it is. But I can not confront and I can not solve my problem. And every day I want. But every failure days.
It's something that happens to me for a long time. Before college. Even from small.
Wishes to escape from the house to the point of making bags. Desire to end it all, to the point of writing letters saying goodbye all. I felt as a nuisance and as a weight.

I hurt myself. I thought as ways to end it all. And this comes from long ago, but he was always there close to you and those feelings did not last more than one day. But now being in another country, away from you despite talking once a week the feeling became more unbareable. I just wanted to stop feeling.

I learned that when I ate so much I had a hard time breathing The only thing I felt was that it was full. So When I stopped feeling stuffed Eat again.
What happened? I gained weight. The weight is very superficial. But that has been a problem for me since childhood. And then I learned to get rid of what they ate. I have purged. And I have taken laxatives.
And when I did not want to eat to not gain weight? I learned that sleeping pills without hunger kept me because I could spend hours sleeping without feeling and without eating.

The truth is that throughout this semester have not made any friends. I have not gone out even once except the trip to Chicago. And all this has me very anxious. It has cost me hours of sleep. I will go to class with anxiety because I do not like to see people or talk to them
I do not want anyone to see what I really am. A very good actress.
Sorry. I apologize, you who love me so much and do not want to me to be feeling like this. I have no reason to feel so. And every time I see around me I feel worse because I have everything and yet I can not stop feeling this way.
I did not want disappoint you. you had so much faith in me. So many hopes. And I let you down. I just wanted you proud of me. Being here and being the best.

I have moments when the rage in myself blasts out when I get so frustrated with myself I just want to beat my head in til dead.  Today I totally lost it with myself and ended up doing my stupid thing of punch my desk as hard as i can til my hand hurt but this time I had my mobile phone in my hand, and blasted into my forehead a number of times, which I've never done before and i must of hit a same spot a number of times that when I stopped after 3 or 4 times which hurt more than usual, I looked down and thought I was having a nose bleed and when my other half came over to me, said I had managed to cut my forehead open abit and it was bleeding like crazy, at that moment I wishing on myself that I was gonna pass out and kill over or something, I just felt sick, the t shirt is covered in blood.  My other half helped me to stop the bleeding.  I'm fine (outside of my head still hurting, and feeling a lil sick) now just got a cut showing how prophetic I really am.    
I hope you guys don't mind me venting on here, I have no-where else to talk about this to or with. 

I know making yourself bleed is nothing special, but when I made myself bleed outside of cutting I had a strange feeling of knowing I could go further at somepoint.  My biggest disappointment was doing that with my other sitting in the same room when I did it. I didn't want her to see be this, she has enough on her plate without fucking useless bf trying to hurt himself.  When the time comes when I do have the guts to go further, I want to go in with a clear mind and end it without anyone else around.

The only reason right now I‚Äôm not dead is for 4 family members that if I killed myself I don‚Äôt really know how‚Äôd they cope.

So many people have hurt me and abandoned me. I never had a father and was always poor in a rich area with a mom who was always working to try and keep us afloat. I also liked videogames and grew up on the internet probably fucking me up more tbh but my dad was a big gamer and people made fun of me for not having a dad and playing games which now is cool I guess. I can barely talk to anyone my age because I mean yes there are depressed people my age but I can‚Äôt seem to meet them in real life. Oh yeah I‚Äôm fucking 18 and I‚Äôm constantly questioning everything probably due to my ocd, social anxiety, and major clinical depression which has been in my family was for what we know at least the past 4 generations. Also they were mostly bipolar so I might have that and the doctors said I might have bpd so yay. I absolutely despise this world and see no point in it other than love which can range from friends family and relationships but I‚Äôm losing faith in that.

Now it had gotten to the point where I figured that most people were just unoriginal idiots who think that they're great and a master of insults and that I was never gonna hear an original insult which I was correct on for the most part this was until I was forced into a video call with my great aunt in a family gathering last year. In this video call she said to me at first sight was ""is the barber on strike"" now this made me die laughing as it was an actually original and funny insult. Hearing this holy grail of an insult made me think to myself ""maybe if I do other stuff I'll hear better insults"" so I've decided to put this theory into motion by dying my hair pink and wear pink ""girly"" if you will clothes to see if I can get a single insult from my peers that isn't ""cut your hair"" or ""ha gay"" and I hope to report back with results once my country decides to grow a brain cell and learn to wear a mask correctly or even at all.",non-suicide

You push your proverbial bolder up the hill to have it roll back down again to only start all over. Tribulations, triumphs, mediocrity. Is there a point? Can you even truly decide for yourself. 

My life has not been uplifting for the past year an a half. Good moments few and far between. I have a wife, or I guess a psuedo wife as we are not technically together at the moment. She is an amazing loving person. But her past is dark. I dont feel I should elaborate. However, her constant gazing into the past and tainting her future has worn this relationship down to the ground. I have played my fair share, if not more, into the situation. She has guy friends, all of whom are single, and I've known about 3 of them since the start of the relationship. Weve taken breaks in the 4 years weve been together to just kind of reset ourselves and try to move forward. But during those times she has slept with other people. Weve gotten back together. Had major fights. A physical fight, nothing extreme. We both suffer from depression and both have anger problems. We also have 2 beautiful girls. Toddler and young girl. 

We get married and not 3 months later shes in bed with another guy... for money... because she thinks I'm stealing from her. I have a bad spending habit but that seemed to be her way of ""digging us out of the hole"" 

I have flirted sporadically with old flings of mine through snapchat, which she found out about. But as the years have gone on, I've never been able to restore her trust... at all... I have forgiven her for her mistakes and have only expected or asked that the same be extended to me. But no.

She freaks out on me if she even catches wind that I'm talking to a female regardless if its causeal, business or other wise but she can continue to talk to whoever she wants. During our recent break she tells me that I can talk to whoever I want as long as I'm open and honest. But then I find out shes been talking to some other dude again which she said is completely innocent. I grab her phone and text the dude. Apparently there was some sort of snapchat conversation where he was saying he could ""support"" her. I inquire about that to him via her phone then he calls me. I question him as to whether or not he knew about me and her situation and he said no.

I lost my fucking shit because i fake that it was so hypocritical. I immediately thought the worst. Shes fucking some dude again. I call her every name in the book. She slaps me. A lot. I spit in her face. She slaps me more. To the point now where I can barely eat. I will admit I shoved her and held her down a few times out of self defense.

347037,"Traumatic impact of fighting parents and feelings of incapability. I want to kill myself, but I don't have the courage to.I don't know what do, and am writing this as means to vent out as I lie on the bed with tears flowing down my face. Feels like there is a boulder on my heart pushing it's complete weight down and trying to crush it.

I am 22, and am an only child in my final year of college, living with my parents. Today, I spent a considerable amount of time overhearing my father beating my mother who cried and squealed, and the conversations in between and after which were just too dreadful to hear. It ranged from wanting to call the neighbours to intervene, to having to force themselves to be happy for me who is their only child else they would have divorced each other (which felt as painful as a sharp knife cutting a vein, the feeling that I am the reason my parents are living the worst of their lives. I hate being a burden to my parents). There was even a mention that they would kill themselves right here and now if it wasn't for my presence. I feel terrible just existing and making my parents indirectly feel like this. 

My parents have fought often throughout my life, but overhearing so much of stuff like this has completely left me in tatters and was making me shiver throughout. Ever since a young age, I have been asked to stay away or close the door and not hear or try to intervene for my own good. However, I did hear them fight always(they are not very good at concealing it) and have gotten used to not stepping in much. But in recent times, it has been a lot more intense, a lot more disturbing overhearing it, but I can't seem to shut myself off it because my parents fighting affects me a lot and freezes me to function normally or ignore it. But since a young age, I have been conditioned not to step in, so I don't know what to do.

I am not very close to my parents like normal families. We don't go on vacations or share our emotions a lot, but I do love them dearly to not make them want to ever feel burdened or upset because of me, and always make them proud. But I feel I still am not talented or capable enough to be super successful and do that. I'm working and studying hard, but I wish I could make my parents more happy because they deserve it. I feel absolutely horrible and on the verge of killing myself knowing that they live such suffocated, forceful, restrained and frustrating lives simply because of me, and I haven't been able to give them enough.

And whenever these fights happen, I am reminded of my wimpy and incapable self as I freeze and feel completely helpless as my parents fight, physically abuse, feel tortured and say the most revolting things to each other. I feel affected, and I don't know what to do. I feel too incapable to intervene , or to do anything about. I want to kill myself because I feel I am just a burden to them and they would have easier, better lives without me in it, but I feel incapable doing that too, fearing the absolute worst they might do to each other with the anger and guilt.

347053,"I don't get it.June 11th this year. I tried to kill myself. I took about 13 40mg pills of Prozac. About 2 hours later I took 20 20mg pills of it. This sum is about 920mg, iirc.

I'd read online it can kill as low as 500mg. 

I don't get it. It didn't work, like, at all. My pulse was completely normal. The hospital monitored me and I stayed normal.

I don't get what went wrong.
Was it that I had built a tolerance to Prozac since I'd been on it since January, at gradually increasing dosages? Was it that carbonated waters -- what I took them all with -- somehow screw things up? Is it that I didn't sleep after taking them (did I have to sleep in order for it to work -- I wasn't tired).

After about 4 hours from taking the first set, I read online something that said a dose of about 200 wouldn't kill but would cause severe liver damage. I became scared that my dose might not work and that I might just get bad liver damage, which I don't want. That's why I told people who phoned an ambulance for me. But, that was 4 hours later. I only did that because I thought it wouldn't kill me.

I don't get it... Why didn't it work? What did I do wrong? Which of these conditions made it fail?

I didn't get help because I wanted to keep living -- I got help because I eventually didn't think I'd die and would prefer living without kidney damage than living with kidney damage. 
But, I could have I'm convinced now -- after further research -- that I could have died theoretically. So... why didn't I?

That being said, it's not like the main theme of this subreddit is foreign to me.


Supportive family, friends, fit, 21/M, parents divorced but that really is a non issue.


I don't feel depressed, I just don't really feel anything.


My regular day is wake up, lift (depending on my specified days), eat, computer (videogames or otherwise), shower, clean, pretty regular.


Anyway, here:


Graduated HS, tried 3 different colleges fucked em all up, through alcohol and general just not giving a fuck. Tried EMS, was basically a test and a gimme away from passing it all, havent gone back. Easy job doing nothing but still making good money with a family business, haven't made the necessary calls/e-mails to do it. Held down a job for a year or so, quit.


The main thing is, every time I think about anything life threatening, or anything along those lines, I get embarrassed. I have had such a simple easy everything for me life, yet I just feel like nothing. So I feel stuck.


Not shitty enough to say fuck it and end it, not caring enough to do anything about it, so here I am, sitting in this pathetic pity party of shit, even feeling stupid writing this. Why am I even doing this?


Everyone in my family is moving on, same with my friends, but for some reason I just wont. I know what I have to do, yet day in and day out, I sit here watching dumbass TV shows, talking with those same people, shooting the shit and having a good time.


I'm having hesitations on even submitting this in case there's an incoming bash saying I have it so easy yet are so stupid to do anything with it. And it's probably true.


Just glancing over the regular SW posts, my post doesn't seem to fit, and I'm almost ashamed to post this here... since all of the people posting before me seem to need more help than me. But I don't really know where else to go, I'm not much of a subreddit browser, I just have heard of this one.


I just feel like I have no motivation.. to really do anything.


If this is not even in a correct place, or it seems offensive, or however you deem it incorrect... you can delete it. I know I don't need as much help, was just hoping for some insight that my endless nights seemingly can't accomplish.

347071,"So uhhh... I had a dream.... I had a dream that i was going around on a rampage killing everything i layed eyes on. It started of as me going hunting for deer. I ended up accidentally shooting a person. In order to hide the body i ate it. All of it. Then i had a sudden lust for blood. After that i went home and killed my wife and child. I then consumed them. I decided to clean myself up and go for a walk, so i did. I took a shower then i went for a walk. I saw a fairly small group of teens so i decided to go after them. Just as i took one down i noticed one was calling the cops. I ran after her but couldn't catch her. It was like one of those neverending hallways. It just kept getting longer and longer, untill i could see her no more.i went back to the others and had a feast. Luckily it was decently close to a forest i could drag the corpses into.  I decoded to start going for smaller children as they cant run fast. So as the days went on, more and more people started to go 'missing'. The cops ignored it at first, but when i took the chiefs child they were on high alert. I hadn't eaten the child yet, for i was planning something. I told them where to find me. They got there in a few minutes. I had his child in my arms and his child was screaming frantically. It was then, that I went too far. I stared him in the eyes as i snapped the head of his kid right in front of him. They were quick to react. Almost as soon as you could hear the wet, cold sound of a neck snapping, the gunfire began. I ended up getting shot in my left shoulder and my right thigh. I had to retreat otherwise id die. So i ran. i didnt make it far.

347078,"I suppose it could be called ""anxiety""Hi! I'm not really suicidal, but I still need help with a depression-related thing. Actually, I've never been diagnosed with a mental disorder because I have never been to the hospital/therapist for anything mental-related, but I still often feel dull and depressed for often no reason. I also find myself hating many people and things, while feeling very listless, lazy, and weak a lot of the time. My life has been very simple. I'm lonely and I don't have real friends, so I stick to the internet, where I write my poetry and also play video games. In the process I also meet great people. I've only had one girlfriend, and in a long distance relationship at that. To sum the relationship up - it was great. It lasted over three years, and she was the best friend I've ever had. We also got very intimate and sexual, and I was basically obsessed with her. And I seriously mean obsessed - She was my only friend, who else would I invest my attention towards? But then eventually she broke up with me, for reasons I understand. Sure, I still feel sorrow from it, but I'm not one to dwell on it and get suicidal because of it. I still feel the same ""depression"" I felt before - That quiet, dull, weakness that made it so I never felt like doing anything. It happened for absolutely no reason. I don't understand if it's actual depression, or just my own pathetic laziness. Like I mentioned earlier, I have never bothered to visit a therapist, so I wouldn't know. Now, it is here that I will bring up my two main concerns regarding the summary I have just provided.

1. The ""depression"". I put it in quotes because I don't know if it's real or not. My parents don't ""believe"" in mental disorders - They say i'm just so down because I play too many video games and rarely go outside. However, when I was as young as ten, I would remember feeling down just like this, for absolutely no reason, even when I was social and active. So I want to know, should I go and get checked up for that? I've always thought I had something, because of the random sadness that would come up inside me, and also the severe anger I would feel at little things. If I should, then can someone explain to me what to do/where the best kind of place to go would be? Just general stuff, obviously, since I have never considered seeing a therapist before. Any information regarding that, or anything I should know about depression, would be greatly appreciated.

2. This is strange. As I mentioned earlier, my girlfriend and I were very intimate and sexual. I was obsessed with her too, in all ways. After the breakup, when I'm no longer in contact with her, and no longer have any of those awesome pictures of her which I used to enjoy, I feel different. I'm constantly, and I mean *constantly* having stomach pains. It's the kind of feeling you get when you're about to vomit, when you can feel the pressure building up your stomach and up to your throat. I've vomitted many times too, almost every day because of it. My eating patterns have been the same as always, so it's not that. I'm also a very skinny person, so me puking daily is not a good thing. This feeling, however, dies down when I am not thinking about her. But when I happen to see a picture of her, or a mention of her anywhere, I instantly feel immensely sick, and either throw up or feel like it's stuck in my throat. I am almost completely sure this has a link with my sexual obsession with her, because I still see her as I did before, as ""sexy"" beyond any other girl I have ever seen, etc etc. Not only that, but if I do happen to see an ordinary picture of her, I immediately get crazy horny. It's a really strange and new feeling for me, because I didn't know it was possible to get that horny and also feel that sick at the same time. So all I would like are some ideas or suggestions for how I can deal with this. Is it a kind of anxiety? Or what would it be? 

If it matters, I'm an 18 year old guy. I know my ""problem"" isn't that big of a deal, but I really felt the need to talk about it and receive some intelligent advice for it, and I would be grateful if some people could help to guide me and recommend things I could do to fix these issues. Oh, and I'm also *extremely* anti-social, self-conscious, awkward, and uninteresting. I'm not suicidal, but often I'll start thinking about it for some reason, wishing I was dead so I wouldn't have to go through this weird confusing feeling.

347088,"I think I'm a threat to womenSince like five or six months ago I'm experiencing a terrible situation. I'm some kind of a lonely guy and I was about to graduate at university. I was finishing my thesis and I had a lot of free time. I became nostalgic about my friends that I had on a previous college I attended (I left because of depression) and somehow there was a girl whom I remembered, she was like my sister there and we are very good friends. Well I started to think about her differently, like I had a romantic interest on her. Years ago I became obsessed with a girl from my high school (Not the same girl I have currently interest with), to the point of basically stalking her (Something that causes me a lot of shame and guilt until today) after she rejected me, she was a friend but I was very ""in love"" (obsessed, in reality, but I thought that way when I was feeling that obsession) with her. I had outbursts of anger and once I had one with her (I didn't threaten her physically but I told her a lot of things one should'nt ever tell a woman). 

In the city where I live now for work I'm attending yoga, a gym, even a chef course in order to have my mind distracted, still I think I'm a serious threat to women because I believe that what happened in high school could happen to me with this girl or with another one in the future. I haven't told her about my interest because I fear a lot of my reaction to rejection. I think I could seriously kill myself, fall into depression or do some crazy thing if she rejects me, so I preferred to cut most of the contact. The strange thing is that I saw her some days ago and I somehow blocked my feelings, I didn't really think about how I felt about her. We greeted and talked and that was it. But if I start to think about her or another woman when I'm alone, I become very anxious and start to remember that incident from high school.

I really love women and I want to read about feminism and all that stuff, because I think they deserve a life free of violence but I fear that once I am ""in love"" I could lose control of my emotions. It's a terrible feeling and I have suicidal ideations about that.

&amp;#x200B;

I lost one of my employees to suicide two weeks ago and I am still reeling. I can't begin to understand the pain or depression she must have been experiencing. By all accounts, no one knew she was struggling with suicidal thoughts or depression. There was no indication that she was hurting so badly and she left no suicide note.

&amp;#x200B;

I am posting here to BEG anyone reading this to not do what you are considering to do. You may not feel like anyone cares about you but I can guarantee someone does. It may be a coworker sitting next to you, your manager, your casual acquaintance, or even a distant family member. It may be an old friend who still thinks about you from occasion to occasion, or it may be a fellow Reddit user.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not here to judge or to make assumptions. I can't pretend to understand even an inkling of what you must be feeling by even visiting this reddit page. But if I could communicate one thing to my employee before she killed herself, it would be this- if you feel like you have nothing to live for, you are not seeing all the things that I see. I am so sorry that I did not make you believe how much you are valued as an employee, as a person, and as a friend. People keep telling me that you were sick and you were on a mission and my actions couldn't have changed the outcome if I had known how you feeling beforehand. Maybe one day I will buy into that, but I haven't yet. I still believe that if someone, anyone, had made you believe you had something to live for, we could have had you longer in this world. You will always be known to others as the girl who killed herself, but I know I will remember you as so much more than that. You will be missed so much.",suicide

But yeah most of my mates are guys and when they hear some of the shit some men have done to me they‚Äôve been fucking disgusted but this shit happens to women quite a lot. 

Now adult men Tf is up with some of them. In my Instagram bio I have my age and make it very obvious that I am underage I do not post any sexual content. Yes my acc in public to which is fine (I‚Äôm trying to start modeling which is why). But anyways back to the point, I HAVE FUCKING ADULT MEN APPROACHING ME!!! it happens a lot the other day this 24 year old college student dmed me and said I was pretty. Like yes ik I‚Äôm pretty but ur 24 and you have ur University in ur bio!!! Like yes he could be a cat fish but like how dumb does a catfish have to be to pretend to be a 24 and approach a 14 year old. 

Ok so now that‚Äôs all covered, I can name 4 sex offenders in my grade alone at my school and guess what they‚Äôre all ‚ú®men‚ú® which as worrying as it is (cause we‚Äôre fucking 14) after a while it is what it is. Now these men are disgusting and you can tell they‚Äôre troubled quite easy because they have many mates and the people who stick by them get as much hate as the offenders themselves (which they fucking deserve) like Tf is wrong with these guys hanging around an offender like cause Ik my school is shit with dealing with sex offenders because they all still go there. But yeah still hanging out with someone after what they did. Ik two lads I. My grade who started a business off of taking photos up girls skirts, the girls they took photos of still have to see their faces around the school. 

Now I don‚Äôt tell many people this like only 3 people in the world know this and the reason why I‚Äôm saying this is cause my identity isn‚Äôt on here. But when I was 8 I got molested by an old man. Of course I‚Äôm not gonna go into detail but it‚Äôs fucked and I hate myself to this day for letting this happen to me. but I was to much of a ‚Äúgood kid‚Äù to say anything and I was just being polite.

I‚Äôm also not doing this to also get ur sympathy in the comments but it‚Äôs shocking that in my country 6 out of 10 women get sexually assaulted by the age of 16.

i'm tired of living for my family or friends. 

i keep telling myself that it will get better in time, i keep telling myself that this is just part of life or that i will soon be happy. but i'm not happy and i never will be. I can try and get help but it wont do anything, it wont work. why is the world so judgmental. why cant we live our own lives without fear of shame and embarrassment. why do we shove our beliefs down each other throats. if you don't agree then you don't. at the end of the day were all humans. regardless of wither or not you believe that God is real or Zeus is real. It doesn't matter because on this earth, all we have is each other. why cant we learn to love. i'm not telling you to accept or conform to others but just remain respectful. when were kids, we don't see race, or gender, or sexuality or politics. all we see is each other and how we love to play tag together. so why is that when we get older, negativity just takes over. you wont realize how much you needed me till i'm gone. i'm not saying that to sound stuck up. i'm saying that because i loved you all. i saw past your flaws and past your negative energy. but you didn't do the same. you pointed out my flaws. you made them seem like it was the end of the world. you told me that i was worthless. you told me that if i didn't change, know one would love me. you made fun of my mental health. you knew. you saw the signs. you read my hints. but you chose to focus on yourself and ignore me. you played the victim while I tried to help you. maybe that was my fault. i loved and loved everyone but i could never learn to love myself. I thought i could be the one to make a difference in the world. silly me. i only soon realized that they were called fairy tales because they never come true. wishes don't come true. your born into this world for a specific reason, to carry out a certain task. sometimes that task is to be an example. i'm an example. i'm an example of someone who loved too much but could never learn to love himself. I was happy once upon a time. but the weight of the world was too much for me to carry. after all, i had already been carrying everyone's problems on top of mine.  maybe i should have been more vocal about my problems. maybe i should have reached out. but as family and or friends, are you telling me you never noticed? you never saw my texts? you never listened to my music? did you never see my sleepless eyes? my slit wrists? my tears on my pillow? are you saying that you never knew? that's a lie. you knew, you just chose to not to do anything. why? were you afraid. were you scared that you would have done more harm? you wouldn't have, have you just told me that you love me. that would have made me look at life in a whole new set of eyes, had you told me that you see my struggles. that i'm going to be okay, that you'll always be there for me. i wanna cry, i want to just hold on to something, i'm tired, this sadness is like a bug who wont leave you alone on a hot sunny day, i want to get better, i really do. but i cant. you wont let me, i wont let myself, I've written so many suicide notes and each day i tell myself that today will be my last day. its not. i cant. i cant seem to bring myself to end it.",suicide

I've been diagnosed with depression and autism and those two are apparently not a great mix. My ADHD meds give me anxiety and that doesn't help. I don't feel like this is why I am in so much pain though. It's been 2 years or so since it's been this bad, and I just wish I killed myself before meeting more people that I care about.

I feel like everyone would be better off without me and even though people say that's not true, I can't agree with them. I only make everything worse in every way and I just want to stop all the mess I've created. At the same time, I feel selfish because I know it would ruin my family. everything hurts so much and I just want to die do bad like I'm always so stressed the time.

347118,"Need help to help friends.Made a throwaway for this post. I wanted to post my story earlier, but today something happened that made me post it right now. 

One of my closest friends had suicidal thoughts every now and then and was harming herself (cutting/burning, maybe more that she did not tell me). However, she no longer has suicidal thoughts. She's still feeling depressed and self harms frequently. Less frequent now though, where it used to be daily it's about once a week now. I've been trying my best to be as supportive as I can for her, listening and msning/texting with her daily. If I could I'd see her daily and talk to her, but she lives on the other country, so when I do get the chance to visit her I'll always take it. I know she appreciates it a lot and says it has helped her so much, to see someone care about her like no one does. 

However, her luck has been horrible lately. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong. I'm not going into the smaller details, since what happened today just shocked me. One of her closest friends told her he had almost attempted suicide today, but did not because of her. Now I have only seen this friend once and never speak to him, but of course I don't want him to do such a thing. I don't know what I can do to help him out, maybe I can't. But I know she can, as a close friend. This did however make her feel horrible. She was all crying when I called her (and I lost it as well). I really don't know what I can do to help both of them out, her to cope with this but him to not contemplate suicide anymore. 

Sorry for not going into much details, I'm afraid she/he will know this post is about her since they browse reddit from time to time. However, I'd love to have someone to talk to via perhaps MSN or PM. In real life I have no one I can discuss this with and it's been getting harder and harder on me to give the best support I can. Especially since I have no one to let it all out to from time to time. Now I'll have to go to bed/study a bit more for an exam tomorrow. I will check back in about 17-20h.

I‚Äôve been thinking of killing myself for years at this point. I can‚Äôt really cite a reason why other than I feel worthless all the time and just don‚Äôt have any purpose.

347135,"It's my birthday, today.First, some backstory.

As of a week ago, we discovered I either have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or Purely Obsessive OCD.

My, um...girlfriend? Woman I love? Whatever. She's bipolar, and she entered her first really big manic phase about three weeks ago. She's confused about everything, has no idea if she still loves me, thinks she has feelings for other people, the whole shebang.

About two weeks ago, we went on what's supposed to be a break. She actually hasn't been single in about five years, and she says needs time to figure her own disorder out. 

As of right now, she has no idea if this is ""break"" permanent or not. One day she's sure she loves me, the next she can barely stand to be around me. The only thing she's sure of is that she needs at least until fall, apparently.

Needless to say, I was, and still am to some degree, scared absolutely shitless. I have no idea how to handle this situation, and my mind will not just let me relax. As such, in my flailing to fix things, I kept pushing her further away. 

I've finally managed to gather myself together, but I feel like it's already too late. I'm getting the help I need for my own disorder, but I can't tell if her frustrations with me are her manic phase, or legitimate frustrations. I feel like I've already fucked things up beyond repair, and the only things that keeps me going is that she agreed to go on a date this week, and that maybe we'll be back together in the future.

I hate what I am. I hate that I couldn't just calm down, and give her the space she needs.  I'm afraid of what I'll do if this turns out to be completely over. Hell, I'm afraid of what I'll do if I botch this date up.

Edit: It just occurred to me that this date is actually today. I didn't even realize it when I asked her out.",suicide

347150,"The story of my 2020 experience. This year was... really hard for me, even excluding covid and all the other world problems, i really suffered horribly this year. I just thought that maybe instead of keeping this bottled up id share it with yall

At the beginning of the year, i was unbanned from the official smg4 discord server. It was the only server i truly ever felt like i was a part of, and i had no friends on discord or irl. And the reason for my initial ban was because i refused to give free money to a mod, so that itself was frustrating. I was able to stay there for a little while, which was fun while it lasted.

Around this time i had met and fallen in love with a guy from my school, and we dated for a little while. He physically and sexually abused me, and kept demanding that i do different sexual favors for him over and over again. Eventually one day he decided to do what i imagine he had wanted to do since the beginning. I was reluctantly naked in front of him one day, and he took that opportunity to rape me.

By then i had experienced lots of drama in the smg4 discord and was eventually banned shortly after this. I broke up with my boyfriend the next time i saw him after the rape (and kicked him in the balls) but after my ban and my rape i had never felt more alone. I did make a few friends in the smg4 server who stayed by me, including one named spring, and he added me to a group chat with his friends. I became friends with everyone else there, and for a time, i was actually happy, knowing i had someone who cared about me.

Until i became the source of a lot of drama, and i was banned. Everyone in the group chat had.. decided to forget all about me, except for one person, named dragonlinx. He stood by my side for pretty much the entirety of may when i had nobody else left, and he saved me from suicide multiple times. Eventually, he helped me reach out to spring and i was able to clear things up with everyone and they accepted me back.

Back in 2018 and 2019 i only had 2 true friends, knucky and korok. The 3 of us loved to have fun together and hang out, but honestly i was an extreme asshole to both of them, and they both blocked me eventually. Around the time spring introduced me to his friends, i was able to reconnect with knucky, but still our friendship was barely existent. 

After a while, me and spring fell in love with each other, and these short months where what caused some of the only happiness i had felt all year. Eventually i met someone named sand who i quickly became great friends with. He was suffering with a failing heart and i wanted to do all i could to make sure he was happy. My relationship with spring was slowly starting to become weaker as we got into more arguments, until he eventually broke up with me in october, and removed me from his life.

Shortly before this happened, almost everyone else also blocked me, and thus began a period of a lot of pain. My only friends anymore were sand, green, knucky, and one of springs friends named sonic. A few months before this, i had discovered a jojos bizarre adventure server called mudalads, and i made a lot of friends there, until one day i was banned for something i didnt even do, and none of my other friends from there even cared about me anymore. Just after my breakup with spring, me and sand had a falling-out and that, combined with my ban from mudalads, broke me more than anything else could have. 

So there i was, helpless, scared, not knowing what to do. I came very close to suicide multiple times. Later sand was willing to become friends again, and i was able to reach out to spring, who rejected my request to be friends again. Me and sand were good friends for a short time, and we started a relationship that wasnt exactly pleasant. A lot of arguments took place and a lot of struggling and anger and pain was existent between us. He later broke up with me, and shortly after that spring allowed me to be his friend again. But later, he went back on his decision and blocked me again, shortly followed by sand blocking me and removing me from his life without any explanation. 

It was at this point that i attempted suicide, stabbing myself in the chest. I failed, as the knife was blocked by my ribs, preventing it from going too deep. Later, a few days ago, knucky introduced me to her friends, and i introduced sonic and green to them. Thanks to them im finally able to feel a little bit of happiness after a long, painful year that was a nightmare to go through. 

Knucky, green, sonic, if ur reading this, thank u for everything u have done for me, i appreciate all of u so much and im so thankful to have u in my life.

So yeah uh, that was just a little vent that i felt like i kinda should get off my chest. I just wanted to share my story with yall, and what happened to me over the past year

If uve gotten this far, thanks for reading, and i hope u have a great day and a great 2021",non-suicide
347152,"I self cured my (almost) porn addiction When I discovered porn a few years ago, I didn‚Äôt watch it all too often. But in these past few months, I‚Äôve really been struggling to stop watching it. It got to the point where I was taking riskier and riskier moves to watch it and jerk off. I was watching porn twice a day at the height, which was a few weeks ago, and I realized that this couldn‚Äôt get out of hand.

My Grandma has a small gambling addiction (my grandpa keeps it under control tho) and I wondered if I could be more susceptible to it. I knew that this had to stop when I realized that masturbating didn‚Äôt feel like anything to me anymore. It just felt empty, and I needed porn to masturbate every.

There were two things that helped me get through this. I was too scared to go to anyone, but I slowly stopped using porn as a means to masturbate, and slowly started taking breaks from masturbating as well. The other thing is the fact that my parents almost caught me a few times, and honestly the fact that they were definitely going to catch me if I kept going at the rate I did scared me.

347154,"Feels like I have ruined my life.Hello.
I hope you guys will read through my post. I really need some support right now.
So my story starts out with me moving back to Sweden. I had previously lived abroad for about 8 years with my family and living as expats. I was 12 when we moved. I was always highly regarded as one of the strongest students in all the schools that I went to, I was always praised for my schoolwork and my intelligence. In kindergarten I took an IQ test on the request of my school teachers and I got quite an impressive score. I was put in the ""smart groups"" at school and worked with other people at my level. All was good.
Then I moved. The school my parents chose for me, was a really ""good"" school by Swedish standards however it didn't really fit me. Everything was too easy. I breezed through everything. This is where my problems started. A friend of my introduced me to League of Legends. Bear in mind this was 2.5 years ago. Well anyway, I have an extremely addictive personality (If I find something I like I get addicted) and because of that I started playing the game like it was life or death. I stopped thinking it was fun and started playing to go pro. Fast-forward 1 year and I realise that my League of Legends career isn't going anywhere. I then switch over to CSGO. I instantly get good. I was competing, getting sponsored and I felt like I was immortal. I even considered dropping out of school to play. My grades started to get worse. From a grade A student to a grade B student. I felt like I was tier-2. (Keep in mind this isn't bad for everyone and if you are a B student it is still super good. Except not for me or my family). I was/am constantly trying to live up to my father who is my idol. He came from the country side and is now one of the top executives in an IT-company. Now I have stopped playing CSGO and video games to try and live up to him, and I am not finding anything fun anymore. I can't study since everything has been a breeze so far, and I feel super horrible. To top it all off, I took and IQ test today and got a score of 103. Right now I am at the verge of tears and it feels like I have ruined my life. Any advice on how to fix my life? Suicide feels like an option since I have failed my family, my peers and all the schoolteachers that have praised me through the years.  ",suicide

I won't share many details but it looked like I had finally found the person that made me happy. But one day I texted. Told the usual good morning and how are you doing. And she said she had to tell me something. She said she was sorry if she was leading me on but she didn't have feelings for me. I was devastated. For the first time ever I started sobbing and it was awhile before I could do anything else. She told me she was sorry a lot and I told her it was fine. I can't control what she does and I don't Wan to make her feel like she has to be with me. I acted like I was OK with it but I couldn't stop crying. Then I jist acted like nothing happened and talked to her normally. The next couple days I was really busy with renovations on my house so I didn't have time to talk to her. But when I got back things felt cold. I don't if she thinks I had just stopped talking to her because I didn't want to anymore or if she just didn't want to talk to me but it didn't feel the same. Like a different person was talking to me. I still haven't had the chance to ask her what's wrong but I feel like I fucked up big time. Like I took things to fast. Like I gave her too much space at the wrong time. Like no matter what I do from here I've ruined everything, again. I've failed in the past. Made huge mistakes that have haunted me for ages.

347176,"The internet fucked up my perception of reality. I feel like I lost my sense of reality almost completely. I've been on the internet since I was like eleven or twelve, I am currently 17 and will graduate from school early next year.

I won't tell you my entire life story, don't worry, but to sum it up: My parents were never home a lot and I occupied myself with the internet, completely unsupervised. Now, I am kind of a goody-two-shoes, always have been, so I didn't do anything stupid, but I watched a lot from the sidelines. I didn't interact with many people online, but I became invested in a lot of stuff, like, I dunno, YouTube.

Now how did it fuck me up? Long story short, I'm pretty much a hermit. I do leave the house, but need a really good reason for it. My life is kind of spiraling out of control, I have no idea what to do in the future, I am completely dependent on others and know next to nothing about the real world.

My expectations are mostly based off YT, Instagram and so on, so basically they are way too high to ever be fulfilled. I know that I won't ever accidentally get famous. I know that I won't ever become a meme and experience my own 15 seconds of fame. I know that I will never be more than a spectator. I lost hope for my life tbh. I do have some things going for me that could potentially grant me a good life but... I have this expectation that everything is just going to be handed to me. I have no motivation to work hard. I keep being shown the perfect lives of others, their perfect creations, their perfect selves; I know that they probably worked hard too, but it *looks* so easy... And I just can't get it in my head that they also had to do something.

I am just watching the world around me... And whenever I am pulled back to reality and have to do something myself, I just get completely overwhelmed. I don't know how to interact with people. I don't know how to operate this vending machine. I don't know how to stand up for myself. I don't even know how to order something in a restaurant without help. I was left alone, on the internet, being fed this false narrative that I can become successful without putting any work into it. Whenever I do try to do something, I get discouraged immediatly, because I see someone doing it better or just don't get any attention. It's awful and I hate it...

Real life feels surreal. I feel like I am just watching everything through the eyes of someone else. When someone calls my name, it doesn't feel like I am that person. I make everything sound so dramatic, I'm sorry, but I really am just this spectator person... I am kind of despairing every day. I hate my life. But I don't know how to fix it either..... Hell, I don't even know if this qualifies as a rant, I'm completely clueless about everything.... I also just feel so lonely as well.. I have people that I like around me, sure, but my expectations tell me that even this is not how it is ""supposed"" to be...

I'm still scared to share too much but I'm trying to say enough that people could at least reply to me and maybe help a bit.

I'm financially and physically destroyed from a previous suicide attempt a couple months ago.

My only friend and ex-boyfriend abandoned me because he couldn't handle someone like this in his life. I caused too much pain. I just brought him down and he needed to live for himself. I don't have any other friends or people to talk to.

I went to a psychiatrist and he put me on Prozac. It's not working. I still spend every minute wishing the pain would go away. This doesn't feel like a regular emotional problem like transient depression - it feels like a chemical imbalance that makes it impossible for me to feel anything but terrible emotions. It feels like I'm unable to experience joy anymore. So you'd at least expect antidepressant drugs to work, but after a number of weeks I'm still just as broken.

I really want to get help and get better, but it isn't working.

Dying seems like a sensible way out. Being this broken and constantly hurting emotionally and physically makes it difficult to find things that make life worth living. Or impossible, I guess - it fucks with my mind enough that I can't do anything to distract me and bring joy. Even writing this post is extremely hard on me from a purely cognitive level.

I feel like I need someone to talk to who cares, even a little bit. But that kind of friendship takes years (or at least months) to develop, and I have really neglected my social life. How do you find people in a situation like that?

 I'm the kind of person who used to hang out on /r/suicidewatch and try to help people, but now I feel hopeless to help myself. I can't even remember what it felt like to not be like this, when I had the heart to try to talk others down from similar pain.",suicide

I've never had the courage, and now I can't do this because I don't want the only person who cares about how I feel and does something about it in my entire life to be hurt. 
I'm just tired. Tired because of my social phobia, of my brothers bipolar disorder, of my parents neglience and their possible disorders, leading to creating 3 socially awkward, immature, mentally ill children despite good financial situation. 
My siblings never had friends of opposite sex. Not a single one. Now they do, because their friends have husbands, wifes and children. And they still live with parents, without a job. I'm the only person in my family which does something, and it was me who was treated badly the most. They told me that I'm the shame for this family. That I'm bringing them shame because school counselor wanted them to talk with her about me. 
When my mother found porn in my room, she started to read it aloud to my sister and threatened me that she will show it to my father if i won't get better grades. I always had the best grades in my year. After that, I couldn't go to school without feeling sick. I still have learning difficulties, because I can't stand not knowing something. I just cry or throw fists in the nearest furniture. 
My father's entire life is work. He works 12 hours a day. My mother doesn't feel the need to help him in providing income. He returns from the work and goes to sleep. Every sentence he said to me could be written in 10 pages book, maybe less. 
Despite that his workplace is next to our home. Despite he is living with us. 
I'm not living with them, but I still can't function normally, because I know what's happening in my house, because my brother threatened my sister and grandma with death while being a driver of car they were in. AND THEY DO NOTHING. And they forced me to go to college, despite I had to go to fee-paying one because my final exam results were too bad to go to any free one. Despite I didn't wanted to, because it's waste of money. Because the subject doesn't even interests me that much. Because it doesn't teach any important skills. It only teaches approach that I always take. It doesn't even matter, because despite of that, I'm getting the worst grades because of phobia and fear of doing anything that can be judged.

In short, I can't do this anymore. There's no escape. I understand my death will cause pain and trauma. That part is unfortunate. However, I am fairly sure continuing to live without merit or will is likely to have equally devasting consequences. 

Hear me out. I have failed at everything I've ever attempted. I was okay at passing exams but that's about it. No life skills. No social skills. I made two friends in high school but that's literally it. My job history is a joke. I can secure okay jobs but I can't ever hold them for over a year. Objectively speaking, I'm bad at most things and this tends to cause problems with employment. 

I'm a 26 year old lesbian. I'm hyper androgynous and everyone is confused by me. It can cause problems. I live in the Midwest and come from a largely conservative family. My romantic life has been my most successful area, but that's not saying much. Sex is fun. But no one will stay with me once they realize I'm a complete fuck up with zero social skills. On top of that I lost the person I wanted to be with. And her kids. She left me for her baby daddy who beats her. I have no desire to date again. 

I can't afford to buy basic necessities. I've been living off of rice and peanut butter for weeks. I have a degree in Psych and 30,000 in student loans. I just started a job in Child Welfare. If I fail, I risk ruining the lives of children who have already endured trauma unlike anything my privileged ass has ever known. If I quit I'm homeless and/or a family burden. 

I bought a gun a few weeks ago. Waited three days. Then bought ammo. I planned to do it that night. But instead I passed out drunk on my bathroom floor with a loaded gun in my hand. Every evening I hold a gun to my head. It's a ritual, I think it will help with desensitization.

347237,"Hello humansThis is my first time using Reddit.

Um...A lot of reasons why I'm making this post. Some things off the top of my head in chronological order sort of? I don't know how else to organize this, sorry.

I'll start by saying I've always liked myself, so no problems there. I think I have a lot of good traits.

I've never really enjoyed living, I guess. Since I was little, I've felt that I've done everything worth doing. I haven't done many things that humans would consider worth doing, but I've done the things I wanted to and enjoy. You could say I've felt very old since I was very young. I felt I'd lived a full life and there's not anything I'm looking forward to.

I've never had a dream or a passion. I've never had a job. I guess I never thought I'd live long enough to even think about it? 12 is the oldest I ever thought I'd get. I never imagined being a teenager let alone a grownup.

Just as I thought it would, things get worse every year I'm here. In every way. I have less fun but more suffering.

Is it possible to be born depressed? I've been able to go to a doctor recently for the first time since I was little, and she thinks I'm depressed. I disagree. I enjoy the things I enjoy. I haven't ""lost pleasure in things"". I just don't get the opportunity to do anything fun. Videogames require a good, working computer and games. I've got no money so can't get them.

I've also been able to go to a therapist recently. We think I'm on the spectrum. I'm smart, I've always gotten straight As, school is pretty easy except I hate writing reports. I've got a college degree. But that means no more scholarships, so I can't go to school anymore. Why I'm saying this is because it's that human things are just too hard for me, and no one understands that. I can't make food for myself usually. I'm able to prepare very few things. I don't have the motivation nor energy for daily living tasks. Having to act normal around humans is exhausting. I'm tired and miserable. I hate being hungry most of the time.

I've gone through a lot of family nonsense, but I've finally gotten away from my abusive and neglectful mom. But things aren't as ""better"" as I hoped they'd be. The place I'm living is disgusting. She's not hurting me anymore, but somehow it's not enough.

I'm asexual, but have/had a fiancee/best friend for almost 10 years. He's the only person I've ever been able to be my whole self with. I've never been able to connect with people outside of teamwork tasks. I just don't know what to do with them. I don't get along with humans well enough to want to be close friends with them. He's been living with me for close to a year. Shortly before he came to live with me, we found out he has bipolar (he also has ADHD, along a several other physical and mental illnesses) . Until he was with me in person, I didn't understand what that meant. I have to babysit him 24 hours a day so he doesn't get kicked out. He came to live with me to help me out with human things, but he doesn't. It's me helping him. He's probably the biggest blow to me of all my reasons for wanting to leave, because I thought I could believe in him. He was my hope. He's why I've stuck it out this long, because he made me believe things could be better. But in person, he constantly lies and hurts me and makes messes and does nothing. I'm at the point I've told him he needs to go. 

I'm having a harder and harder time every day just ""going with the flow"" and trying to live. If it wasn't so hard, I could try harder. I wouldn't want to leave if I wasn't always suffering. I thought my options were increasing and was more hopeful after I got access to a doctor and therapist and my fiancee came to ""help me"" and I got away from my mom. But I'm at the end of my rope.

I hate being poor, hungry, lonely, struggling with just existing, everything. I've been trying hard, but I just don't want to suffer anymore.

I tried to write everything clearing, but it feels like a mess. Sorry, writing and explaining is really not my forte.

I don't really know why I'm doing this. Maybe to try reaching out for some other option for a final time. I've tried therapy, I've tried being hopeful and trying hard...",suicide

347245,"I am seething with rage and I don‚Äôt know where else to post this.Suicide is not at the top of my mind at the moment but I struggled with those thoughts in the past and this community has been very supportive. I feel extremely unstable, like the tiniest instance could change things. I‚Äôve never felt this much emotion and this much fear of the future.

My girlfriend broke up with me last week. We live together, just signed a lease and took the master bedroom about 10 days ago. I can‚Äôt afford it on my own, but fortunately one of the new roommates was kind enough to trade once the ex moves out. Unfortunately she‚Äôs broke, not moving out til next month. And even more unfortunately than that, it‚Äôs not a clean break.

She was abusive, cruel, many other things I swept under the rug to keep my life stable. It was a mistake, the two dozen times she reached peak rage and cruelty mode I ended up begging for her forgiveness for things like rolling my eyes at a manipulative comment and not remembering an argument from months ago.

It was really bad, I am still processing now that it‚Äôs ‚Äúover‚Äù. She ended it because I couldn‚Äôt remember what I did with my friends when I got blackout drunk at a party, she accused of being a narcissist because there‚Äôs no way I wouldn‚Äôt remember, it went back and forth for days with name-calling and ridiculing and escalating to the point where I‚Äôd walk in the room and she‚Äôd say ‚Äúpiece of shit!‚Äù repeatedly until I left. It‚Äôs finally stopped because the new roommates moved in and she can‚Äôt scream at me anymore. I got through it because I know I‚Äôll be able to start healing once she‚Äôs gone.

But that‚Äôs the thing. What just threw a wrench in the whole thing is the other new roommate. Male, 8 years older than me and 10 years older than her. He‚Äôs fat, talks a lot, mega-hipster who values things like fine wine and whiskey and a nice cheese platter. I‚Äôm not exaggerating, he‚Äôs caricature. 

This fucking bastard, knowing the situation, knowing she‚Äôs moving out and it‚Äôll be me and him living together gets friendly with her. And unfortunately for all of us, the walls are thin.

First couple days, I was like ‚Äúwhatever, I‚Äôll forget she ever existed after she‚Äôs gone and we can co-exist despite him clearly being smitten with my ex‚Äù.

Fast forward 3 days of him hanging out in the living room with her for five hours at a time, talking endlessly, and finally the kicker when he word for word says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome to use my room for *personal business*, I don‚Äôt mind‚Äù.

Right after I typed that I went in and tried to talk to the ex about it. How I‚Äôm freaking out, I don‚Äôt know if I can live with that guy, I lived here for 3 years alone before you showed up and now I feel like I‚Äôm being forced out by this shit, and overall just how I don‚Äôt know what to do.

She scoffed, she told me to shut up while I was talking and at the end she said ‚Äúha, you treat someone like shit and now you‚Äôre approaching them as a friend. Get the fuck out of here!‚Äù

I‚Äôm worried about my future. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going to go, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll find a place I can afford with room for all my things and close enough to work, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll get a handle on the rage I am feeling toward her and that fucking guy and this situation. How my home for 4 years fell apart because I allowed this woman to walk all over me too long. It wasn‚Äôt enough to tear me down as a person. I know it‚Äôs not her fault this guy‚Äôs a fuckhead, but the situation is playing out because she lost control.

I feel so much, I don‚Äôt have a safe space to get my thoughts together. She bursts in the room every hour to use the bathroom or try to start a fight. It‚Äôs so fucked, I don‚Äôt know what to do.

347257,"I want to die, but I don't want to hurt the people I loveI also don't want to leave anybody behind when I go. 
But I'm just so tired. 
I've contemplated it so many times and i'm slowly being pushed further and further to the brink.

Ultimately, i don't think i will do it, at least for now. 
I have a little sister, a grandmother, pets, and friends who i care about too much to leave.

But I don't know what else to do.
I'm just so tired.
I don't know where to go anymore in life.
I'm graduating and I'll be headed to prom soon, next year I'm off to a really great university. I have a pretty good life compared to a good amount of people, but most days I feel too sad and tired to get out of bed

I feel like I don't deserve to live here, that I'm just a waste of space and everything I do is awful. I have a wonderful group of friends and a great little sister but I can barely leave my room and when I'm outside I spend so much time in the bathroom just crying and trying to breathe

Every day I contemplate suicide. I have all of the materials ready whenever I choose to use them. I plan my steps out, where it will happen, how, what I will write as a note. I want this so badly it hurts but I care too much about some people and it's preventing me from ending my stupid life.

I don't know what's wrong with me, but whatever it is, I can't tell anybody because I don't want to place this burden on them (which is why I'm telling you guys)

I guess one question i have is, should I drop all ties? I don't know what else to do. I don't want to live anymore but I don't want to hurt others with my death. Do I just hurt them enough for them to leave me, and then die alone without hurting anyone?

Another question I have is: what is wrong with me? I know my dad's decided to leave our family behind to live with his mom and sister's family instead. I know that my mother's a pretty emotionally abusive person, as is my grandfather. They've told me that I'm a waste of human life multiple times, but I guess as of these past few years everything's sort of piled up and I just don't know how to deal with it all anymore. 

My issue is that my life, while not ideal, is not as awful as a lot of other people, and yet that doesn't stop me from wanting to die. Why? Am I just selfish?

EDIT: Wow! I really didn't expect all of these answers! thank you so much, everybody. Just wanted to update everyone on stuff. So for a good amount of my life I've had problems with self harm. I'd scratch myself a lot and I had a pretty severe eating disorder due to a really intense coach and being called a fatass by my parents at a super young age. Today I actually made myself eat with people rather than hiding in the gym locker rooms and telling my friends I had too much homework. One thing that helped as much as these sweet messages was this guy at school. I was kind of minding my own business and I usually remember to smile so people don't feel all that worried over me, but this guy comes up to me and sits next to me for this movie we're about to watch and says:

""I know you're upset and you have a lot going on with you right now. Have some of my candy and don't be sad!"" 

I mean, I ended up not really eating the candy and telling him I was just tired, but I was so surprised to see someone that I'm not even all that close with come up to me because they saw through the shit I pull with people. It made me feel better.

I'm still in a really awful place at the moment. I had a moment of weakness and self-harmed and purged my lunch, which sucks. I also still really want to die, or just not really be here, but spending time with my sister and my cat definitely helps me ignore these feelings. 

So I guess for now, I'm still really messed up in the head for stupid reasons, I still want to die, but I know that as long as I have someone to care about, and as long as I think people might at least care a little about me, then I'll live. 

I'm scared of the day where I just stop caring about the people around me and go for it though. It's going to happen one day, maybe sooner then I think, because despite how much I care for some people, I still have this tired, empty feeling and it's killing me. I want to die so badly, but at least I know that for now, I'll suppress these urges. 

Thanks again for all the wonderful messages :3

Since leaving her state she's lost an absurd amount of weight and weights under 100 pounds at 5 foot 7. Hasn't eaten in weeks, takes fat burners and whatever crazy supplements to destroy what remains of her body, and will not be convinced that she's doing something wrong here.

She attempted to kill herself last night and failed. I can't for the life of me get her to understand that being abused was not her fault, that she did not kill her child, and that she's destroying her body. I've been at this for more than a month and I'm running out of things to tell her.

Everytime I go out in public it feels like I'm invisible. The only reason I haven't ended myself yet is because of my love for video games. I dont care about anything else in this world.

I don't feel that 'family bond' that a lot of people talk about because to put it frank, I find them annoying and unnecessary. All the memories I have with my mom is her yelling at me, telling me that I'm a failure/devil's child, or her crying about how hard her life is. Her life is hard, and she does love me but every time I try to talk back she just says, ""You can't yell at me but I can yell at you, you don't have the right to but I do because I'm your mother."" Which is a crappy and bullshit answer. (She actually says that) She just finds reasons to yell at me and when I say she doesn't do it with my brother she tells me that I complain too much. I think I do complain too much but what else can I do? My 'family' just gave me the physical needs to survive but didn't give me enough mental/psychological needs. My dad doesn't know English and just gets bullied by my mom a lot, I feel sad for him, he's a good dad. He thinks things logically but he's too nice. My cousins are just people I have to get along with because I'll be seeing them for the rest of my life, same with everyone else. I think the main problem is my Mom and I can't wait to get them out of my life. Maybe then I'll start being grateful, miss them and start remembering the good times I've had with her instead of thinking she's the worst. It's an emotional roller coaster with my mom and I feel like she's a narcissist/she is very entitled/egotistical because she just guilt trips me and because she's my carer I can't do anything about it. She claims it's for the better but I think she just does that to make herself feel better about how she's treating me. Recently she forced me into a program, said I didn't have to do it because she's ""opening doors"" for me, so I quit (because I didn't want to do it and she told me I didn't have to), she then gets mad at me for not ""consulting with her,"" forces me back in and now she says, ""I changed my mind, you don't have to do it anymore."" AFTER I finalized everything with that program. What the actual fuck? I can't fucking take this mental abuse anymore, I want to end it but I'm too scared to die. All my efforts to be successful will go to absolute waste because I was destined to fail no matter how good my grades are and no matter how hard I've tried, and the reason is, is because I will end my life by my own hand one day.

And the writing on the statue,

I won't give up 'cause there will be a day,

Never thought I'd do this on my own. (On my own...)
But now I wield the sword you left behind.

when i go to sleep i think about killing myself. more and more lately.

i graduate in a year. i don't want too. i don't have dreams, i've just been rolling along with life and graduation means being proactive and i don't want that. 

i wish i had dreams. i just don't care about anything. i can't take anything seriously. the idea of dreams makes me laugh. i think that's why my six year relationship ended. i couldn't take her dreams seriously, couldn't imagine that she was doing anything but taking the piss, talking about being a singer to annoy me with impossibilities. 

that was months ago now. havn't been with someone since. 

i'm fat and i hate it, though not enough to get off my ass and work out. i bought a plane ticket to spain, and i'll be walking the camino for a month but that's just a way to kill time.

a lot of my life is just killing time. one hour gone, another, back to sleep, wake up, fuck, kill more time. i'm bored of my hobbies. bored of this entire charade, to be honest, but i'm too much of a pussy to actually kill myself so i'll just bitch at strangers and hope their sympathy makes me feel better about myself. i don't deserve to feel better than myself, i'm a piece of shit.

i can't stand talking to people, it confuses me, makes me anxious, yet there's nothing i want more than to be a normal person. i have a friend, i think, he might hate me for all i know and i don't really care. he's just a guy i've lived with the past few years, i can't see us remaining friends after graduation. i don't care enough to maintain relationships, my high school friends having all drifted away one by one. 

i'd go to a therapist, but i don't want to face my fucking parents. i hate them and i have no reason too and i hate myself for it. i can't make them bury me, but my family is long-lived so i'm dooming myself a very long wait. 

dying would be the easy way out, i think, and i've takent he easy way out all my life, who am i to kid myself. even if it takes me ten years yet, i'll probably end up offing myself. been thinking about it for five years now, i'm sure i'll get around to actually doing it sometime. 

i should be working, studying for my finals. i've been up for eight hours and have yet to shower, let alone crack open a book. my grades are fine, i guess, but could be a lot better if i gave a damn. a lot could be a lot better if a gave a damn.

but i don't, no matter how much i hate myself for not doing it, and i can't motivate myself, and why shouldn't i just kill myself, end this whole facade, i'm not really living a life anyway, just observing everyone else live theirs.

i'm going parachuting next week. maybe i won't pull open the chute this time. 

i wish i could accept who i am. lazy, misanthropic, narcissistic. that'd make things much easier, but i hate myself and why shouldn't i? i'm a terrible human being. i steal from my friends, food or weed or a beer here and there and think nothing of it. i can lie without remorse. maybe i'm a sociopath. no wonder i have so few left, i wouldn't want to associate with me.

I'm a gay teenager.

It's also worth noting that I don't have any friends close enough to open up to, and so I ""need"" a boyfriend who I can be open to, if a teenager can even justify ""needing"" a relationship. Because as much as you guys are great, I'd rather talk to someone I love than use a burner account on a VPN and Tor. Why am I using a VPN and Tor, you ask? Next reason.

I'm probably a pedophile. When I was younger, I vowed to take myself out if I turned out to be like ""one of them"". What a shitty surprise. I've noticed that I've been looking at older children's  to preteens faces and butts and am sexually aroused by the thought of sleeping with one, although I'm also disgusted by that. I have never watched actual child porn, although a temptation exists. I am in a degree of denial, however, because of that moral disgust and also because I'm attracted to people my own age. What I'm afraid of is that the people I'm attracted to will stay the same age. In that case the likelihood of suicide goes up from the current 40% to about 75%, if we're being scientific. But strangely enough, I'm not worried most about that, I'm more worried about my loneliness than the fact that I've probably got a brain that's similar to that of some sick fuck that gets his jollies off on torturing kids. Perhaps I should be more worried. And no, I will not be getting therapy for this, I'd rather be dead than spend life behind bars for a mental illness I have zero intent to act on. I swear, I'm relatively normal outside of this, I have superficial friends, I don't bring my teddy bear to school, I don't wear a fedora and have a five-o-clock shadow. But I'm not sure if I can live with this, regardless of if I should or not.

Finally, there's the fact that my depression's not going away. At this point, my brain is ruined and I'm not sure I can handle genuine contentedness in life, nor am I able to achieve it. I've been on multiple different medicines, had different types of therapies, and nothing is working to fix me. Another beautiful thing is that even if I am fixed, I'm still broken.

Typing this all out has taken away some of my fears of suicide. I still don't have the courage to do it now, but maybe that will come. Like many depressed people, I don't really want to die, but increasingly it seems like the best option. I'm a man of science, and unfortunately there's no scientific ways to fall in love and, well, not be a pedophile. So this is what I'm left with. I see that ""the main rule is 'Please don't be explicit about methods'"" so I won't. I'll just say that I found some good drugs from a seemingly reputable and reliable online source, and it's just a matter of saving up pennies and courage.",suicide

- I've had depression on and off since I was about 6 and have felt like a piece of shit for most of my life.
- I have extremely high expectations for myself that I'm never able to fulfill - career-wise, hobby-wise, interacting with people-wise, anything-wise. I spend most days feeling like I'm on the brink of catastrophic failure (even though my rational mind knows this isn't true).
- I've never had a relationship last for more than a few weeks, and I'm still a virgin. This adds to my feelings of failure, especially considering once I pass the 30 threshold with my virginity intact I'll be a living, breathing internet meme - the last fucking thing I want for my life.

My 30th birthday is almost exactly 10 months from now, and I recently started considering methods, which alarms me. I ABSOLUTELY do NOT want to end my life this way, but my brain is trying to convince me that this is a very logical and tidy solution to my problems‚Äî it restores all the control in my life that I feel I lack.

I already plan to attend a fan conference out of town during my birthday week, so I will be around other people and will not be sitting alone at home. But there will be alcohol and drugs available, and simply acknowledging my birthday might be too much.

347328,"stuckI'm stuck

There was a point in my life where I really wanted to die. 

Now, I can't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I live a relatively privileged life. My family is kind, I have good friends, I go to a privileged school. I get to do and see things that many don't see in a lifetime. The world around me is beautiful. But I don't feel worthy of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I started feeling like I wanted to die. No idea why. I'm not clinically depressed. I have no mental illnesses that I know of. I just hated my soul. Not myself. I hated the being I had created. I was in pain. I am a very appreciative person. And that has become my downfall. I appreciate the world around me so much that I have diminished myself as a human being. I love everything. And I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to die.

&amp;#x200B;

This feeling continued for a long time. But now I have reached a point where I realized that I am not worthy of feeling sad. That I am not allowed to feel the satisfaction of feeling suicidal. Because I am privileged and I am supposed to be happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel sad, then I feel angry, then I feel depressed, then I feel suicidal, then I feel mad at myself for being suicidal, and then I want to die all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that if I were to kill myself, I would cause so much pain to all the people around me. They would think I was selfish to do that. Do i really exist just to please other people? Am I just sticking around so that other people don't have to suffer?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to die.

&amp;#x200B;

Because then other people will get hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I go up to my room and cry my eyes out for fun. Then I sit, forcing myself to smile in the dark. Because I'm not supposed to be sad. I'm too privileged to feel sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I was never born. Then I could just not exist and nobody would feel the pain of me leaving. Because I was never there in the first place. But now I'm stuck here. I only matter when I want to leave. Otherwise, I'm meaningless. But perhaps I shouldn't pity myself. After all, that would be awfully selfish of me.

Even with that, I still went to the hospital and fucking cried over her bed back in February. I sobbed while my brother and sister hugged me, because I thought my mom was fucking dying, even after all the horrible shit she did to me growing up. For a little context, she's diabetic, and her blood sugar was in the 700s when she was brought in.

I have doubts about my future and career. Now I don't have a clear purpose in my life and nothing much to live for.

347434,"Thinking about taking a driveI'm writing this because I think I'm going crazy. I've always said to myself that I've had so much to live for. I have a brand new baby girl, she's almost a year old now. My girlfriend and I split up a few months ago and we're in the midst of a court battle for custody of my baby girl. She's saying I've abused both her and my little girl. ""abuse"" was always a point of contention for us. Not toward my baby girl, but toward my ex. She would say I'm abusive and tell me how little I care about her and I would apologize even though I didn't even know how I was supposed to have abused her. I would tell her I've lived through abuse, seen my first step father hit my mother. Fought him to make him stop hurting her. And then I'd tell my ex that I never wanted to be that and that if I was she should leave. She would later say that I'm not abusive. But now that we're in court she swears that I've been emotionally, physically and financially abusive. Truth is, though I know the last two are lies, I don't know if the first is or not.
I'm very, very solitary. I don't have many friends for a lot of reasons. I've always been ahead of my peers intellectually, but very far behind emotionally and socially. I guess dealing with my first step dad for a so long made me stop feeling things. All I had was my library card and it was the only way I could get away. I read everything I could get my hands on.
I also can't trust people. I learned not to, I guess. I'm told that I put up walls around myself that people have to vault over to get to know me. My ex was someone who didn't make the jump.

What I'm trying to say is... I'm not sure if simply not being there for my ex emotionally, not trusting her with anything qualifies as abuse.

But that's not really the whole thing. I've been having these dreams for a while now where I would take my mom's car for a drive. And every time I dream it I get a little farther. But one night I got out of the car. The next night I wrote a note, begging my mother not to try to find me. The next night I left her a message on her answering machine, telling her where to get her car. Then I picked up a bag and went into the woods. For a few nights I'd just get farther into the woods. But last night I pulled a pistol put of the bag and put the barrel in my mouth and I'm afraid to go to sleep again because I don't know what's going to happen.

I know I can't kill my real self in a dream. I can't kill my real self because somebody has to pay child support for my baby girl. My ex doesn't take care of her and on the weekends i get to see her my baby girl has scratches on her legs and she has feces on her bottom, but she has a clean diaper. I tried calling CAS, but they say I don't have enough evidence to open a file with them. I feel so helpless and I'm scared that if I pull the trigger in my dream I'll lose what's left of my soul. I don't want to wake up and just be a shell.

But then I think that maybe that's all I deserve. If I deserved to be a dad I would be one. If I deserved to be loved I wouldn't be alone anymore. Maybe all I deserve is work. 

I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense. I'm not sleeping much anymore. I overload on caffeine and nicotine trying not to go to sleep.",suicide

And just last week, she moved away from everyone she knew to live in a city about an hour to the south with her mother.

About 45 minutes after I get off with them there is a knock at my door and it's 3 fucking cops. So my day went from bad to absolutely hellish. I acted like I had no idea what they were talking about, and they eventually left.

I'm so fucking angry. I will never contact any type of mental health service ever again because of this shit.

I've tried therapy, medication, etc. if anything it's only made my depression worse.

I can't talk to anyone about it now for fear of this happening again.

So I'm going to hang myself before I turn 29 next month. I have no desire to a 30 year old virgin, with absolutely no hope of life getting any better.

I've been told the same old bullshit line ""it gets better"" for years now. It only gets worse, it only gets more lonely, and when you try to seek help 3 assholes with guns show up at your door. Not a doctor, not a mental health precessional, no of course not.

347462,"Its finally finishingI've had severe depression for 5 years now. There's not been a day for at least 4.5 years where I've not thought about ending it. Since October its focused a lot more. I developed emetaphobia - a phobia of vomiting. As a result I can't touch any surfaces and any time I have any symptoms of norovirus I panic. Every day I feel sick and I'm tired now. I can't even kiss my girlfriend. My parents forced me to see a psychologist and in the initial assessment they said I have OCD and severe clinical depression. In the past few weeks its gotten worse. I can't even eat any more for fear of ingesting something that will make me sick. Once you can't eat its pretty much game over right? I've lost 4 stone in the past 2 months. At 6.8 stone and 5ft 9 I'm simply waisting away. Each day I'm alive feels like hell on earth. My girlfriend cries for me every time we talk about this. I can't stand this fucking torture anymore. I can feel the end coming. I feel nothing for my girlfriend or anything anymore. She loves me so much and I know I love her back, but I can't feel it anymore. The last week feels like I'm turning the final pages of a book. I'm reaching the end and really it makes me feel happy. I can only imagine the bliss from this place.

347477,"I'm lost, I don't think I fit in anywhere in this lifeI (32/f) have been self harming and thoughts of suicide come and go but this morning on the way to work, so persistent that I'm not sure what to do. I have a very loving and supportive partner, but I frequently go to them for help and fear that by leaning on them heavily I am emotionally abusing them. They have their own life to attend to and can't 'treat' me - I see a therapist too, once a week but it's not been enough.

3 years ago I finished grad school and have not been able to find full time work in my field. I left a full time job I hated, which paid well and had fantastic benefits, in order to pursue that degree. I performed well (so I thought?) but despite applying to jobs like crazy, I have had interviews and sometimes second interviews, but never a hire. The pummeling of rejection have led me to believe that there is something inherently wrong with me, that I am unacceptable, and that informs my poor performance in future job interviews, which causes me to continue to not receive offers. I'm paralyzed as to what to do next, because I feel every decision I have made in the past has led me to my current failure and that I can't trust myself to make a good decision, so I'm just stuck in this cycle.

I do work, but I'm miserable in my job. It's in my field, but part time and for most of the day I just sit here, which leads me to dwell on my failures.

I also don't want to have children and have never planned on a family. I've always planned to be this highly creative and independent career woman. Which is not happening. The only other path I ever see is women pouring their time and energy into a family - which I don't want. So I'm left with...just being a failure at my career, and I have nothing else. If I'm not a career woman or a mom, what the hell am I doing? Where do I even fit in?

The fact that I have two degrees but still no desirable skills which means no job offers forces me to believe that the problem is me, I am inherently wrong, unacceptable, unfixable. So my choice is to continue living this apologetic, pathetic existence, or I just let go and end it. I don't know what to do.",suicide

347488,"The future is so daunting.26/f/USA

This week I met a group of people I've known online for 4-5 years now. It was a huge high point. I haven't felt loved like that in a long time.  But after we all went home, I started feeling really down. A couple of other people told me they felt the same way, but I don't want to overuse them for emotional support.

I don't have much of a support system IRL and I really don't want to burden the people I do have around me now.

I grew up in a household with no emotional support whatsoever (childhood emotional neglect describes it pretty well) and I've had a longstanding pattern of latching onto one or two other people and just using them for emotional support until they get tired and leave. I don't want to do that again. One of the friends I met helped me yesterday when I was freaking out. I feel like reaching out to him again today, but I really don't want to be a burden or put too much on him. And I don't know if that's me being respectful, or me being 'waah waah dont worry about me, i'm nothing'. I do have needs, and I've learned to respect those needs in myself a little more, but I still have this nagging feeling like I'm going to ruin friendships again by being too needy. I'm just afraid.

I live with my parents right now and I've never felt comfortable showing emotions around them. After reading lots of books on the subject, I realize that they're both very emotionally immature. Their emotional lives are very shallow and they seem okay with that. Even though I know why, and I know neither of them will ever be able to give me the semblance of emotional support I need, there's still that little kid inside of me crying to mom for comfort. And it hurts. I've always felt like I had a deep black hole inside of me. 

Also, I'm at a point of potential major choices in my life. I grew up not knowing what the fuck I was going to do with my life and ended up getting a fairly useless BA. After school, I went through a long depression after not being able to find a job, then I moved back home and this continued. Then I got a job for about a year and a half which was really depressing (processing disability claims), and then I decided to quit. My decision was to pursue teaching English as a second language and I eventually got a certificate to do that. Now I have a job offer in Vietnam and I just feel paralyzed with fear.

I think at the center of all of this, I just feel like I'm not enough. Like I won't be able to do any of this stuff I set out to do. Did I even want to teach in Vietnam in the first place, or is this another stop on the ""what the fuck am I doing"" train? TEFL isn't exactly the most long-term career. Like, what the fuck am I going to do with myself if I go there and hate it? What other fucking choices do I have? And even being in Vietnam, I'm going to be one of the fattest people there. Part of me thinks ""ok, maybe I'll learn to get over it"" but I know I'm going to get tired of it. I think that's another thing. I feel tired by it already. I always feel tired. Then when something like this comes up, where I have a big choice to make in my life, I jump straight to ""well, I should kill myself"" because it all is so fucking daunting. 

That's my suicidal ideation pattern- whenever I get to a point where I'm like, ""I don't know what I should do"" in the big picture, I go straight to wanting to kill myself. Like, I intellectually know there's people who care about me and all, but I just don't feel like I have what it takes to succeed in this life. And I feel like I'm doomed to repeat my failures- spending years of my life doing absolutely nothing like I have in the past.

347524,"Suicidal, Begging For Help and Turned Away - Retaliation From A Crisis Center Because I Turned In My Sexually Deviant TherapistI went to the hospital in the back of a police car yesterday against my will.  This was a first for me. 

I have a lot of trauma I haven't dealt with yet and every once in awhile it percolates up and this morning it happened.  After crying on the bathroom floor for a few minutes my mom came in and asked if I was OK.  I was too upset to respond so she just walked away and left me on the floor.  She came back after awhile but I still couldn't talk.  Shame overwhelmed me and all I could think about were suicide scenarios to finally end the suffocating pain that wells up inside me like a tsunami.

After about 40 minutes of crying on the floor I realized I had been away from my daughter for awhile and needed to get back to her.
When I stood up I could see myself in the mirror and felt disgusted.  I slapped my face repeatedly and as hard as I could, punishing myself for being the horrible human that at the time I thought I was.  I grabbed my laundry to go home and I almost made it out of the cabin before mom stopped me.  I told her the memories I was having from my childhood and she denied everything, invalidating everything I felt.  I started to really lose it, my voice screaming as loud as it could at her that I wanted to die.  That's when her husband came tearing out of the back room with a finger pointed at me so I ran away.



I ended up under a tree on the property.  It took me about 15 minutes to run through my DBT skills. I still felt sad because DBT does not take away emotion, it simply provides a means to regulate emotions.  I went to the fifth wheel and was just starting a movie when I saw a sheriff car pull into the driveway.



I went outside and was surrounded by four sheriffs.  I have had many interactions with this department prior to DBT but this was different.  I explained that I had been upset and ran away but did my skills and was much better, no longer suicidal at all.  They didn't believe me and forced me to go to the hospital.  The sheriff that drove me to the hospital was cold and short and wouldn't explain to me what law he was enforcing or why I had to go to the hospital.  Luckily I have skills and was able to not react to his hostility and just went with the situation so I could get back home to my daughter as soon as possible.  I saw the doctor briefly, explained myself and was promptly released.



The next day I called the Sheriffs to find out why this interaction was so different.  Turns out I had told my mom ""give me a gun, I want to shoot myself"" which she relayed to 911.  According to the sheriff deputy I talked to all they heard was 'gun' and that's why there were four of them and they were so serious.



It was during this call I learned the most horrifying fact and it has blown my mind.  A couple years ago I was seeing a male therapist that was going through a divorce.  He ended up telling me he thought about me when he pleasured himself, as well as many other disgusting comments.  I reported him to his facility but wasn't taken seriously.  After he told me about pleasuring himself I reported him to the neighboring county's facility, where I had been a patient years earlier.  I eventually sued the county facility that employed him and was quieted with a 50k settlement, of which I got 24 after the lawyer and fees.  I wish I had taken it to trial but my lawyer basically said no.



A year after the lawsuit I was doing really bad.  I was in the emergency room three times in two weeks for suicide ideation.  The hospital set me up an appointment at the neighboring county's mental health facility, where I had been a patient years earlier and the same facility that I had reported my sick therapist.



I was barely hanging on, waiting desperately for my appointment.  An hour before the appointment I got a horrible phone call.  It was the facility cancelling my appointment.  They said that my medicaid wouldn't cover it because I don't live in their county.  I attempted to explain that I did live in their county, my mailing address is in the other county.  I also tried to explain that medicaid has different benefits in different counties and I knew my medicaid was in the right county because my medical doctor only takes the same county's medicaid.  It's confusing but basically they were lying and I knew it.  The person who called ignored me and just kept repeating that her director would not allow me to be seen.  This is the same exact director to whom I had reported the sexually-inappropriate therapist.



I hung up, cried and cried and started to picture my suicide in graphic detail.  Terrified and alone, I called the facility back and asked to speak with the director. I tried to explain to her but I was so upset and had been so desperate for help I was furious that they were denying me their services.  I begged and told her I was on the verge of suicide with a specific method and hung up because I was so upset.  I called a final time on my way to commit suicide.  I called to thank them for pushing me to finally go through with it.  I told them where I was and my plan and then hung up.



When I got to my planned location I realized there was a complication and I wanted to be sure this wouldn't be another attempt.  I was working on the complication when a sheriff stopped.  I asked him what county this was and he reassured me it was the county I thought it was.  He was disappointed to hear what happened and offered me a ride to the hospital which I happily accepted.  All I wanted was help.



I stayed in the hospital for 12 days while a psychiatrist adjusted my meds,  The only access to a psychiatrist while on medicaid in Washington is through inpatient psychiatric hospitalization.  There is not a single psychiatrist in Washington that accepts medicaid.  My only option had been my medical doctor and it wasn't working.  Not at all.



When I got out of the hospital I was curious about the facility refusing to see me while in crisis and had a sneaking suspicion it had something to do with my lawsuit against the neighboring facility.  I called and stated that I had a friend in crisis that didn't live in the county but was suicidal and they didn't hesitate.  They immediately said to bring her in, it didn't matter what insurance or where she lived if she was in crisis.



Since that phone call I filed a grievance with the ombudsman.  I described that I thought I was being retaliated against and I wanted to make sure that never happens again.  I got a letter saying they got my grievance and I tried to let it go.



Until my phone call with the Sheriff recently.  You see the sheriff couldn't find a 911 call on the day I was rescued.  There is no report or call at all for me that day.  THEY NEVER CALLED 911.  That sheriff just happened to be driving by, which explains why he didn't have lights on.



Let me reiterate that: the mental health facility that is also the acting crisis line not only cancelled my appointment and refused to see me for a completely false reason (they lied, I've checked with medicaid- they lied about that and it didn't matter anyway, I was in crisis) they DID NOT CALL 911 after three phone calls begging for help and telling them my plan. They've called them in the past when I stormed out of the office but after being the victim of a sick therapist and reporting him, they not only refused to see me but would have been the last people to speak to me before a very successful suicide.  Isn't a crisis line obligated to call 911 if a caller is in imminent danger?



On top of all that, later that same day my mom called the facility to find out what happened.  She had been at the emergency room with me and knew I had that appointment.  They not only broke the HIPPA laws and spoke to her about me but they told her I cancelled my appointment.  That's right, they lied and told my mom that I had called that morning and cancelled my appointment.



This is the county-funded mental health facility that cancelled my appointment an hour before it was supposed to happen, claiming it was because of medicaid. They refused to see me and sent me into crisis and did NOT CALL 911 when I was seconds from death.  The only reason I am ALIVE right now is a sheriff happened to be driving by.

I guess I'm just worried that one day, when things aren't going well and I have a weak moment where one cut goes deeper than before it'll cross my mind. Like the scent of an ex lover caressing my memory.

And it's a really scary thought. As of right now, 6 years after I found my mother I find it completely selfish. But will that change over time. As the sickness sets in. When I have a family and people that depend on me?

Create an account, write a post, done.
Anyway, the ""text (optional)"" box before submitting a post made me laugh.

*stares at the blinking cursor*

I'll start with this then. I have social anxiety disorder, this kinda makes life a bit difficult with it usually involving other people haha.
I was too scared and embarrassed to call the suicide hotline, so here I am, afraid that I'm going to hurt myself.

I used to think that I had everything I needed, a future, a relationship with my best friend *(side note: It's a long distance relationship)*, and enthusiasm for basically everything.
Until my best friend broke up with me, more than once. The first time she broke up with me wrecked me emotionally. I threw up, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, and I was alone. The reason she broke up with me was because she couldn't handle being in a relationship that made her happy (a bit more on that later). So she blocked me on every messaging platform. We weren't **that** serious back then, we never even said ""I love you"" to each other.

So a month went by and I tried to deal with the breakup, which I wasn't doing very well. And suddenly I get this message from her. Nothing special, but it fills me with a bit of hope. Lo and behold, this message turns into us getting into a relationship again. Only this time more serious. We didn't FaceTime before because of my social anxiety, but I slowly started to make an exception. We felt comfortable, everything was going great. We talked about everything, and we both supported each other.

The reason she broke up with me because of that is because of her issues. She has some family issues that messed with her psychological and emotional development, which means that the 'best' way for her to deal with things in her eyes is to push everything away.

I started to get used to her 'breaking up' with me all the time, she apologized after her episodes, and we moved on. But only after she blocked me a million times. I think the way she did it and kept saying ""goodbye"" scarred me for life.

We started saying ""I love you"" too each other. It was the best feeling I've ever felt, looking into her beautiful eyes (even if it's through FaceTime) and telling her that I love her (and of course her saying it back). Plans were made, dates were set. The long distance part hurt, but it was all going to be okay. A plane ticket costs basically nothing and when I turned 18, we would be able to live together.

This was of course all ruined by my now former drug addict friend. He's still a drug addict.

He kept fueling my now ex about how bad I am and how she should break up with me. This of course were the drugs talking, but she didn't know that and thought ""he actually knows him so it much be true"". This combined with her issues didn't end well for us. She trashed me, called me every bad word in and out of the dictionary, and pretended that everything was okay while wreaking havoc on everything around her. So she broke up with me, blocked me, and immediately moved in with some loser. But only after pretending to say I love you to manipulate me into saying something to her.

This was half a year ago. My former friend has since then apologized for his behavior (after denying everything) before returning back to his drugs.

My dad tells me that she will eventually realize that she's unhappy with the loser she moved in with and go back to me. 99% of the things he says are true. I can't live without her. Everything I do feels useless without her and I miss her so much. Sometimes she still texts me to say that she's depressed, asking for help, saying that she misses me. She also tells me to fuck off after that.

The pain only increases the more time goes by. My dad keeps saying that everything will be okay and that I just have to wait for her, but it's been half a year. I'm going crazy here.

There was also something about being semi-engaged to her, but I honestly don't know where to put that now.

We met in 2015 and I instantly thought she was cool. I don't know what to do without her.

That's about 1/3 of it. Phew, venting kinda made me feel a little better.

This year i had a lot of time to sit down and think. 
I found answers for questions that bugged me my whole life. I'm not for people. I am who I am and I'm an unlikeable emotional slob of a person so I'm incapable of even having one good friend. Nobody is capable to love me, platonically or otherwise. The only person who was there for me died a month ago.

The tipping point was today. I realised that I don't even have a single soul to celebrate new years with. It was and is the only day that is so, so special to me and now I've realised I'm rotting while still alive.

347553,"I want to break up with my girlfriend but I am afraid she will kill herself..When we first started, our relationship was amazing... We both have depression, (although mine has been reduced greatly) and low self esteem. I still love her... but not in the same way anymore. I don't feel content in our relationship. I am very artistic and while she is very artistically talented, she doesnt care much for art or making things in general. (I know, minor thing but creativity is a huge part of my life). She will get upset anytime i pick up a guitar to sing her a song (she didnt use to, but for the past few months she has), or just to play in general... I need someone who is creative with me or at least supportive of me in a relationship. We used to laugh and have fun all the time, and be able to talk about nothing for hours on end and never get bored with each other... Now when we are in a call for more than an hour some kind of drama happens, and she gets really sad and starts crying... and I understand its not her fault and i honestly feel like such duchebag for wanting to break up with her for something she cant control but its really taxing on me mentally... I feel so stressed, so much more that when we started dating. We have been dating for 8. almost 9 months now... For 2 months it's gotten miserable for both of us, after my mom walked in on me fingering her, we have had to had a camera on us at all times. We can't kiss, we can't hug too much, we can't cuddle for hours on end like we used too... and i feel like thats a huge factor for why our relationship isn't working anymore... when we had physical touch taken away to comfort each other (not sexual im referring to by the way, mainly just cuddling) everything fell down hill.
We get in a fight almost every day now over different things, and its gotten to the point where i actually try to avoid hanging out with her as much as possible instead of the other way around...
She has anorexia, and has really bad body image issues and after becoming severely underweight she is now slightly overweight and feels worse about herself now than she ever has.. I still think she is beautiful and obviously i cant cure that about her but her constant negativity and self loathing brings me down with her...
She is the best relationship i've ever had. The only one i felt was genuine, real, and great (for a while) but Its gone downhill and is no longer what i want or need in a relationship... I feel like i have to constantly walk on eggshells or she will cry or have a mental breakdown and its so stressfull... I love her but i cant do it anymore. I cant do it for much longer.
She has told me many times that i am the only good thing in her life and that if i broke up with her she wouldn't know what she would do and she has had suicidal thoughts more and more often... She has been to a mental hospital before (as have I) and i feel like as soon as i breakup with her she will have to go again.... she is already unstable enough as is and if i break p with he rright now she will do something irreversable...
I was thinking i would wait until school started to break up with her... either the day before or day of so that she would have friends to support her and be around other people... We are both going to different schools next year (both starting high ",suicide
347554,"Suicide calendarHello all, I expect this to be eaten up by all the other sad sacks of shit just like me but I thought it may be worth a try. I‚Äôm 16 years old and I‚Äôm autistic, I‚Äôve gotten the brain power to carry me through school but I can‚Äôt for the life of me socialize. I did have a girlfriend recently but she dumped me after I told her about me being autistic. My family is just now realizing how severe my autism is and are thinking that disowning me will help with this. I disagree but in the case that it does I‚Äôve set my suicide date for the end of next month, that is Tuesday, March 31st of 2020 I believe. Anyway back to my demented little story time of which I‚Äôve only told one. When I was younger my parents divorced while I was 2 years old, me my mom and my brother were kicked to the streets and homeless for about a year I believe. During this time I saw and did things I would rather not say. After we got a foothold after some help from my uncle, we all know where that goes, we had my dad come back and say he wants custody over us. But me and my brother disagreed, my dad was very mentally and physically abusive, which I don‚Äôt like. He ended up getting weekends and so I‚Äôve found the only way I can get through those times we‚Äôre by not thinking or feeling anything, this has resulted in me being diagnosed with psychopathy, which in short means I feel nothing I care nothing which I don‚Äôt think I enjoy much either. After all this I assumed things were looking up, I was making friends at school through studying comedy to make the laugh, because I loved laughing even in the worst of times. I was growing more and more fond of my family and it almost seemed I could break through this shell I had put myself in. I got a girlfriend who I loved and she was the first person outside of my family who I enjoyed touching, hugging was amazing! But I found that she has cheated on me, very un fun if I‚Äôm honest. Then my closest uncle who I trusted has died recently, my Dad, as much as I hate him has cancer and my Mom who I still hold a soft spot for has a tumor. My stepdad who I‚Äôve just started ‚Äúgrowing on‚Äù is pushing me away along with everyone else in the family because I‚Äôm simply trying to tell some jokes. I just want everyone to be happy again, my brother is moving out and now all the pressure to be a successful student is put on me, along with every other chore. I‚Äôm getting skinnier and skinnier by the day because I‚Äôve given up on my eating habits and instead opt to stay in bed after school. I‚Äôve had to move schools to be put in a better program and despite being more than halfway though the year with 83 days left in it I still have no friends because I shake very badly when I talk to people. But I want to talk with them I really do, I want them to understand that it‚Äôs not that I fear them or can‚Äôt control myself. But that‚Äôs all mostly gone now. In the corner of my bed I‚Äôve found a very empty spot emotionally and I feel something but it‚Äôs more of something pulling me downward. I look in the mirror and am disgusted at what has become of me. I go to school every day on time, I eat the same things every single day I wear the same things every single day and I liked it but now I feel like it doesn‚Äôt matter. I feel as though nothing matters. I‚Äôm officially alone now, writing this in a somewhat desperate attempt to find someone to maybe talk to over the web so that they don‚Äôt see me shake.

I really wanna talk to someone, but who? It's either they don't care or they try to pretend like they do.

It all starts somewhere, and everything ends. Not everything has a happily ever after, if you think about it deep life never has a happily ever after. It's either you die sick (not happily ever after) die of old age ( fuck when your old you never enjoy life) then there is die in an accident (you never thought that you would die) and then suicide. It's very rare that you die a happy man. 

Sometimes you just wanna disappear, not die just disappear . Sleep is the closest think to disappearing, but it's either you can't sleep because all your thoughts they just consume you, they don't let you do anything, sleep paralysis another issue with me, I wake up in the middle of night, suffocating I can't breathe those dreams are not dreams it's reality. And what's a dream when you can't sleep? Even if you do sleep waking up in the morning is very hard, you don't wanna wake up you're living a nightmare. Its a dream you can't wake up from. sleep is like death but without¬† commitment. 

People don't kill themselves for no reason at all, to you it may seem like they want attention. But you give them the attention when they're gone, when we don't want the attention, but when we wanted someone to notice us and reach out to us, you did nothing. I don't know if you noticed or not maybe you did but just didn't care, I don't know and I don't know why you decided to ignore the problem, but that was your decision and not my story to tell. you   tried to ask for help, but couldn't get any, your problem couldn't be solved. I understand that you don't want me to get upset or worry about you or anything. but you raised so many questions in my head, was it because of me?

the more people we meet the more they hurt us, sometimes they bring smiles, but its hard to find those. no one wants us they just pretend as if they care, when we go they sometimes realize how much we were to them. you never realize how much she was to you until you let her go, right? well thats the case for some of us. 

suicide doesn't kill people its the pain and sadness of life that kills us. we need that reason to live, just one strong enough reason that's all we need. But that's what we don't have, that motivation, that person to put a smile on our faces. It's just something to keep you from jumping in front of a train. 

Cutting, a lot of us do it, but why? What do we get from cutting? Nothing you think it takes away the pain but no it doesn't, it just harms you more. I don't cut. If you slit your wrists it's attention that you're looking for. I would understand why you cut if when after you cut your problems go away, but no they don't just because you're suicidal doesn't mean you cut. Get that in your heads people cutting gives you nothing. All it does is give you more things to worry about. It doesn't take your emotional pain away, it only gives you more pain emotional and physical. And also the unwanted attention, maybe you do want attention I don't know.

""Will anyone stop me?"" Four simple words with really deep meaning, four simple words that speak so loud. what do these words mean? Those four words it shows the desperation and pleading of someone who needs something needs that one thing, we just want someone to hear us out, to see us. We can't hide what's inside us, we're tired holding the trigger and not pulling it, tired of everything. We've lost ourselves. Is anyone gonna watch us? Hate runs through our veins. There is a side inside a darker sod that no one should know know about, this side can't get out, ever. 

The voices inside they're killing me, when your thoughts become your enemy, your trapped inside this world of thoughts which is your mind. All that's left is rage now, you regret everything the good things and the bad. I'm living in hell, living in a nightmare, I'm not scared of going into the real hell now, I feel like I'm prepared and nothing could be worse than this right? Home doesn't feel like home anymore. Stay alive for what? I keep telling myself that it gets better and I can survive and suicide is only for the weak ones, but now I doubt that. It's not for the weak it's for the ones that have it really bad. I know a lot of people have it worse than me and some are gone already. My fears control everything, I don't wanna go back home. I keep telling myself that I can survive this god-forsaken place.

1. I want to talk to my parents, I want to help my dad get rid of things we don't need and stop getting things we don't need in the first place, I want to get him to be calmer when he's stressed or in an argument with my mum, I can't talk to her, so I'll talk to him

2. I want to study more, and better, and like it like I used to, it's going to be hard to get into that space again but I really do want to

3. I want to do more with art and coding, I love them and I don't think I give them enough time and commitment, I want to do that, properly, and grow them a bit

4. I want to write consistently, I want to finish my story, I don't want to forget it and leave it, I want to get it done and I want to have someone read it and like it

5. I want to get some weight on, I'm so fucking tired of being underweight, I want to make it stop and get it together, I don't want to hear about it from someone else again fucking again when I already know it. Just say I'm not fucking hungry and have people not point that out, fuck metabolism I don't care I'm going to try as hard I can (yeesh I don't think I've sworn that much in a paragraph in a fair bit sorry)

6. Fix my sleep schedule, I don't want to be scared of it anymore, it's bad when my head comes up with the most freaky horrible things, but I want to *not* stay awake for a week straight sometimes thank you

347630,"My last act will be giving my abusive family and ex-fiancee a body to wake up to on Christmas day. I am a kind, sensitive person but have no cares left to give.I just want to get this out there, not as a cry for help but as a last attempt at some human communication before I die tonight. Why should we be forced to live in a world so fucking cruel? My self worth was decimated in my childhood to the point where I can't cope with the challenges you have to face to be happy. Job interviews, dating.. simply sitting and planning out a path for my life are too anxiety inducing to bare at this point and my whole world has completely collapsed.

When I was eight my dad died from cancer and I was raised by a single mother. From the outside she looks like this strong woman who raised two kids through turbulent times but in cold hard reality she was about as terrible a parent as you can get. She constantly threatened to 'run away' and leave us when we were naughty, routinely told me I was adopted, moved us in with various boyfriends and blamed me personally for the failure of the relationships (""my life would be so much better if you were never born""). When I was 11 she made me beg one of her boyfriends to take her back when he broke up with her because he didn't like the fact she had children. Another one of her boyfriends was 'permitted' to physically abuse me in pretty extreme ways. I would get hit with planks of wood for not unloading the dishwasher and put in arm bars for talking back. I have never heard her admit to being wrong about anything, never heard her apologise and really can see no way to get along with her when she is so extremely different to me. She is racist, has no interest in education or anything more intelligent than reality television and lives off of a tiny monthly life insurance/government pension paid out to widows.

I was painfully shy as a teenager and threw myself into my studies as a means to escape. The one thing I still had going for me was my ability to concentrate because depression hadn't kicked in yet. I left school with straight A grades and went off to study at one of the best universities in my country, it is placed alongside Ivy League universities in world rankings. I wanted to study medicine and become a cancer specialist but I didn't have the self-esteem to apply and opted for human biology instead. Just before I left for college I went to a party in my hometown and met a girl who was about to go and study medicine at a college around 100 miles from mine. It was a perfect night when everyone from school was there saying goodbye to each other and I must have looked a lot more popular than I was with everyone coming to say goodbye to me. She approached *me* and got talking about my plans for college, our chemistry was insane and then she started kissing me. It was unbelievable, she was incredibly beautiful and smart and only had eyes for me. 

I have serious commitment issues and it took about 6 months for me to tell her I loved her, but we talked every day about how much we missed each other and would visit each other's colleges on alternating weekends. I just couldn't get her out of my mind. That Christmas she introduced me to her family and I saw what a real family is for the first time. Loving, interesting conversation, day trips, vacations. The next year was like a dream. She took me to Europe and we visited fifteen countries by train, sleeping in shared hostels and having sex in public bathrooms. The second year was tougher, depression and anxiety began to consume my life but she was loving as ever. I was on a lot of medication and gradually pushed every other person out of my life but she would come to my apartment and put out the bins, buy me food for the week and help me study. I trusted only her. By the time exams came around I was in such a terrible state I turned up to precisely one of them and was told to take a year out by the university's welfare officer. I did that and tried to get better. I tried to run and exercise, see a few friends here and there but the illness was too tough to properly overcome. I was in my twenties and had never had a job, I felt pathetic in every way and strongly considered suicide, but my love for this girl kept me alive.

I returned to college and after a year of anxiety hell managed to complete my studies. The only reason I graduated was that I chose every class that didn't have a final exam, as I knew one exam would be too much pressure. Instead I had endless coursework to complete for random classes about globalisation or the history of science leaving me with a degree totally irrelevant to any industry. 

I was so lost and embarrassed in life, I had no idea how to get a job and didn't want to talk to any friends. I deleted almost everyone from social media because I couldn't stand to see their perfect lives. Once again my girlfriend came to my rescue and took me on a road trip across the US. Again, it was incredible. I asked her why the hell she was with me. She told me I was tall, handsome, intelligent and she knew that just as soon as she graduated and we moved in together I would finally be able to build the confidence I needed to succeed. She truly believed in me after all that time. I asked her to marry me. She said yes, but she wanted a perfect wedding so just as soon as I had a group of friends to attend and we were earning some money we would do it. She graduated in August and we moved in together in September. She started working at a nearby hospital and I went and interviewed for a job in retail to pay my half of the rent. I planned on volunteering, making friends and working on getting a better job this year. From September 1st to November 1st this year I no longer had depression. I was getting up every single day, going to work, coming home and making her dinner. I was fixing up a bike to travel around the city and going out for dinner once a week with my soulmate. Then she left me. She knew everything I'd been through and promised me for years that we'd be happy once we got our own place. I travelled every weekend for 5 hours each way on an old bus to keep her company, make her dinner and take her on dates. 

She has no interest on working on things and says she hasn't loved me for two years, but having someone to help her through the end of med school was 'comfortable'. These last two months have been insufferable. We still sleep in the same bed. All I wanted to do was pull my life together and show her that I'm capable of stepping up and providing us with a great life but some nights I can't help but beg. She has only become more cold and spiteful with each day. She says I'm not a real man, I'm not funny, I'm terrible in bed, she is going to bring other men home and have sex in our apartment. I guess our sex life fell into a rut but she always finished before me and I made her laugh all the time. She doesn't tidy anything in the apartment and I have to run around like an abused housewife washing dishes and cleaning up after her but I can't afford to live anywhere else and I can't go back to my mum's house. It's like a monster has replaced my beautiful angel. She says she is so happy without me and now she's gone to her parents for 10 days. They are *my* family too at this point but I'm not allowed near the house. Her dad is my closest friend other than her and is in denial that she has done this, saying she is just stressed with her new job. I haven't spoken to her for 3 days but tried phoning this afternoon with no answer. Now I have to go and spend Christmas with a family I thought I'd escaped and have barely spoken to for years.

A place without meaning
Not a glimmer of light is present yet he still persists
No matter how much he dreams of a future of light and prosperity

347653,"I am so proud of my dad. I needed to share this because it means a lot to me. So, my dad has always had a bit of a temper and made some poor choices when I was younger. At some point I screamed at him that I don't trust him, and he doesn't deserve my trust, and much worse things. This was me beginning to process what happened, and as I got help with my mental health I calmed down and realized he was trying to change, to make up for it, but I wasn't giving him a chance, and was probably hurting him quite a bit. I paid attention a bit more and saw him actively trying to control his temper, and he's made a ton of progress.

What led me to completely forgiving him was when a sibling exploded on my parents and insulting them in the worst ways imaginable, and my dad screamed at him to not talk to his mother like that, took the door, grounded him, and left to calm down and make sure our mom was okay. Then he checked in on me, because I was in the room next door and struggle with cptsd, being triggered every time an adult yells. He hugged me and apologized for yelling, and I just told him most people wouldn't have been able to keep so much control in that situation, I certainly wouldn't have.

For the last several years he's worked so hard to get us everything we need and want, spent thousands of dollars on vacation for us, we've gotten to try so many new things and had so much fun. He very rarely yells at all, even when he's angry, and if he is too mad he will walk away and wait to talk. He also joined BACA (Bikers Against Child Abuse) to help kids who've been abused. He loves it, and everyone there is so nice and he fits in so well in it. He looks big and tough but will stop everything to help someone. 

Changing so much takes an exorbitant amount of work, most people wouldn't be able to change the way he did, especially not in a few years. Some people close to me wonder how I can forgive him but I don't think he was ever a bad person, I think he was just really lost, but he pulled himself back together. He really deserves so much and I'm so grateful.

I have multiple Incompletes for my coursework, am unsure if I‚Äôm going to pass a minor I worked hard for, and may or may not graduate. The ceremony is in a couple days but I don‚Äôt want to go if that isn‚Äôt indicative of me actually graduating. I‚Äôm burnt out and am considering drowning myself in a lake. 

I went through so much shit with my ex. Had to take Plan B twice, almost relapsed several times, withdrew from my communities and went MIA, and experienced suicidal ideation during the latter part of the relationship. I‚Äôm so stupid for taking him back all those times. I don‚Äôt want to lose that much control over a guy anymore. I don‚Äôt want to be reminded of how crazy I was for neglecting everything except him. I feel like a failure for struggling with everything. I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. I‚Äôm trying hard not to relapse and drink. Cutting seems to be the only thing that can help me deal with life, but I can‚Äôt stop doing it. If I stop, I‚Äôm afraid I might go with my plan.",suicide

When i first came across the term suicide in my childhood, i never cared about it. But when i had failures in my life, i kept thinking suicide as an option. I then started to have repeated thoughts of suicide, whenever i fail or felt humiliated. Why?

My brain would have created a new neural connection for suicide when i heard it the first time. Over time whenever i failed in important things in my life, the neural connection for suicide might been activated every time. My brain could have then made that neural connection stronger and stronger making it an easily accessible option whenever i failed in something. (Cognitive ease could be the culprit).

May the right answer would be think rationally and not emotionally whenever someone feels suicidal.

347738,"Getting ThereI'm at a point where I'm starting to think about not living, objectively.

I lost my wife to ovarian cancer in 2016; We'd been together for almost ten years.  Reflecting on everything as I've been for three years, I took caring for her on as my identity.  I still am, and at 33 I have no idea of who I am.  I failed out of college due to inattentive ADD and depression at 20 - I was alone.

I think this is why I clung to her so closely, I feared being alone.  Now I've lived in a different state for three years.  I'm still mostly alone - Everyone around it seems has someone, or something - A passion, a drive to succeed, friends and family or just to enjoy something tangible.

I'm still depressed, still incapable, and still feel wholly alone.  When others recount their stories of youth, I have none.  I've never truly known who I was, but took on qualities as best as able from those around me.  I'm exhausted.  I've tried therapy recently, along with doing things to improve my health and to get out and meet people.  Nothing is truly working, and I feel I'm becoming a burden on the few people I can talk with from time-to-time.

So what would the world lose, honestly?  Who would the world lose?  Objectively, nothing.",suicide
347741,"Tired of tryingI don't even know where to begin. I'm a 30 year old psychologist, with training and a lot of experience in therapy and helping others, and I want to die. I'm sick of always being there for other people and them never being there in return; I'm sick of having jobs where I do good work but end up burnt out because of the crappy way the NHS works and the shitty management and bitchy colleagues that this field seems to attract; I'm sick of not having a job right now, I did a masters and got the highest grade and have so much experience but still can't get a job I would like to do; I'm sick of feeling like everyone else is moving on with their lives and getting what they want out of life and then here I am, hating myself and feeling worthless and that my worth is only based on how much I can do for other people rather than anything else. I'm sick of bad relationships, feeling like this is karma for leaving an unhappy relationship before, feeling like everyone just goes away eventually - is it me? Am I so terrible? I like to think that i am a really kind and thoughtful and considerate person, and actually I am, and I am REALLY good at my job and psychology and research and everything but where has this got me? No where. 

The only reason I exist is to keep my parents happy, because I know they would be devastated if I killed myself, and because I want them to be ok and they really need someone to look after them because everyone has flown the nest and I am the only one who seems to care enough about them to do things with them still, and I can just see that when I'm older my life is going to be caring for my parents when none of my siblings will help and they are elderly and ill.

But now I'm seriously thinking that they will be ok, and if I am not around then maybe someone else will step up. And so I've decided that if I can make my death look like an accident, that will be easier on my parents because they know I am clumsy and accident prone. So it's what I want to do. 

I don't even know why I'm writing here. I suppose the whole of my life I have just really wanted someone to talk to, who's not going to go away. I have a boyfriend, but he is on holiday with his family and his crazy controlling mum doesn't know about me because she thinks he doesn't need a girlfriend and shouldn't have one, so he had to go to sleep because she controls everything about him still (he's only a couple of years younger than me) and he needs his 8 hours sleep or I don't know, the world will end or something according to her. So i'm really upset, and he had to leave and go to sleep (8 hours ahead timezone at the moment). I am actually going to therapy recently too, and my therapist is lovely, but i feel like she is overwhelmed with all the new stuff I keep bringing every session. There's a lot of it. And I've been to therapy a few times before, and it's helped to a certain extent, in that I understand why certain people have done certain things adn the why some things are as they are, but it hasn't changed how i feel, that I am just alive for my parents sake.

So yeah. Sorry this is so rambling and crap and whiney. But I'm tired of trying all the time and the thought of just dying is increasingly irresistible.

I am usually tired most of the time, doesn't matter how much I sleep. I am also frequently ill, and regularly become very hot temperature-wise and feel very sick which I believe is connected to my diabetes. (type 1, hereditary)

My life feels so... long? not sure how to describe it. I am currently repeating year 12 (uk) as last year got fucked due to various illnesses and my diabetes deeply affecting my life, which led to me finding out that I had it (diagnosed march).

I have a few friends. Only two I can spend a lot of time with, all the others irritate me in some way after a certain amount of time. I am introverted, sure I'm going to get annoyed after some time socialising, but it can be near instant with some friends. for example one cheated on his gf last year and had no regrets or anything and treats all women as objects. I can't help but be jealous of how easily he can talk to and get with girls however. i like to think in his position i would be nicer to them but i can't really say as i'm not in his position.

most other people im just not on the same wavelength as, bare two people. one is a girl that i have had feelings for and has had feelings for me, she is with someone currently. we have fantastic chemistry, no joke, we almost were fwb but i pussied out. turned out we both had feelings for each other during that. as we found out later. we shared nudes. i wish i was the guy i am now back then (bare the suicidal thoughts).

the other person i get along well with is a guy, known him for almost 6 years now (wow, just realised that). we fought occasionally but that was long ago. he's a pretty cool guy so long as he isnt around this other friend of mine who makes him arrogant for some reason

family wise, i have no complaints beyond ym dad who really irritates me the way he eats and coughs and sniffs which sounds really weird. idk why but whenever he makes such noises it really pisses me off, like sets something off in my head. not sure what the deal is with that. but yeah no divorces or deaths except for my grandma and that was not sudden.

people tell me i am funny, i am nice, etc. mainly family or guy friends. i am shit at talking to girls. i go out of my way to avoid them. i hate myself for it but when it happens i am not the person who wants to talk to them.

sorry my grammar has fallen apart as this goes on. i type faster this way.

schoolwork has been good this year as i know most of what i am doing :)
however i have a complete lack of motivation. right now i should be doing product design. i was home ill and i have done almost nothing all day. similarly to socially avoiding girls i regret it after but am a different person during.

anyway, I don't have much going for me. if I manage to pull off good grades then maybe i go to uni. then i get crippling debt. I dont even know if id like computer science (degree i am currently looking at). even then i have no guarantee of a job. heck i wouldnt mind just working office hours and getting a decent paycheck, maybe accounting would be better.

anyway, eternal sleep sounds better than the everlasting boredom that is my everyday life. im not looking to escape anything in particular, just a shortcut past this period. before you say it gets better, i have been like this for 2 years. (began shortly after relationship with a different girl ended). no sign of ending yet, except for the occasional burst of happiness. it would not be difficult for me to end it too; a simple insulin overdose puts me to a coma then to sleep, apparently.

ah well. let me know what you think SW, im all ears. respect to those who listen here, i have been talking to a depressed friend with suicidal thoughts and it isnt easy.

Now, this was a year ago, I was staying up on a Sunday as there was no school the next day. I was up at 11:00 AM watching videos on how to stay aware in situations after seeing recent events about shootings and terrorism. Now I went to sleep after a few videos or so and I woke up at 10:00 AM sharp next day.



The next day, we had to go to get groceries. We decided to go to a well known Indian store for groceries as we were going to have a big party next day. As we enter the shop, it was very crowded full of people we usually didn‚Äôt see if we were to go there another day. Now it was just my dad and me as my sister and mom were staying home. As we enter I hear 4 guys saying,‚Äúno not that guy,(referring to my dad) the other kid(referring to a little kid).‚Äù Now I notice as in the video It gave tips such as use your surroundings and avoid eye contact. Now how I used these was that went behind a few aisles where I could hear them but they could not see me. Then I saw  the cashier‚Äôs monitor with certain cameras. I had full vision of them and I could hear them very easily. My dad was with me and I told him about the situation. We decided to leave and tell the cashier about how sketchy they were. At this point the 4 guys decided to act as they released they had no time. I noticed them getting closer to a kid and I used another tip from the video. Use unexpected things to your advantage. Now really there was a lot of things I could have threw such as chip bags all the way to pans and pots. I was near the entrance and found the only thing I could use that could cause damage was rocks outside as the pans and pots were on the other farther aisles and chip bags and naan rooti wouldn‚Äôt do anything. So I went to get a rock when suddenly I realized the door made noise when opened or closed at a distance. I‚Äôve went here for like 5 years so I knew when It would make a noise when I opened the door. I was able to grab a few rocks (no small ones, a few big ones and 1 HUGE rock) and as soon as they were about to grab the small kid and I hit all 4 of them with a lot of rocks HARD. I‚Äôm talking almost causing coma hard. I think its because my adrenaline kicked in at the right time so after some hard hitting throws we called police and they searched them and their van(it was white and windows were tinted) and they found pistols and knives in their pockets(very small I couldn‚Äôt notice them) and the car had even more weird shit but I didn‚Äôt see what they had but hey, I saved a kid.


The kid‚Äôs mom was deaf and the kid‚Äôs dad had to go use the restroom so he was very vulnerable but now they realize that threats can happen and are more careful
now. 

Also, for me my dad actually thanked me a lot  for noticing and said he was really proud so yeah the compliment made my day!

The kid didn‚Äôt know what happened and he thanked me after he realized they were gonna take him and he wanted me to have his toy as a gift as it was the least he could offer so that‚Äôs that. 


The 4 guys, idk what happened for them as they were arrested.(I‚Äôll update on that later) Also, they were really gonna do messed up shit with the kid but we didn‚Äôt the kid since like cmon now he‚Äôs a kid.


The crowd wasn‚Äôt sketchy or anything. just new people.

347762,"Lost my wayFeel so lost and empty anymore, and i keep thinking about ending it just to stop feeling the negative emotions... i feel only the bad emotions, anxiety, sadness, ennui, hopelessness, haven't felt a single positive feeling since last year... i graduated from law school and felt nothing, no triumph, no happiness... passed the bar and felt nothing... now i'm unemployed and feel nothing... except for misery and the hopelessness of student debt...

Unemployed, in debt, depressed, isolated, unloved, ugly, fat, stupid, useless and a drain on my family... i try to tell myself that things could get better, that i can change all of that, but i'm losing faith in it, and it all just hurts so much... i know my viewpoint is distorted, that's what they say, but it all feels so real, and i can't seem to force myself to believe otherwise...

Worst thing is, i'm turning into the kind of person i hate, negative, paranoid, unsociable... it's pushing the few people who vaguely care about me away, and i can't live with who i'm becoming.

just don't know what to do... just saying this out loud helps though... makes it feel more like something real, and not something that's just in my head and my fault for feeling this way.  everyone says i have nothing to be sad about, but no matter how bad i feel for feeling this way, i can't seem to feel better.

What can i do?  god, i'm so unhappy... i don't have a solid plan, i don't want to make my family or anyone else find whatever's left, and i don't want to cost funeral expenses.  been enough of a drain so far.  i know it's selfish to go, but i think everyone would be better off without me.

tell me something that can help, point me back to the road... give me something to hold onto when i feel this low... please..",suicide

347765,"Why? Why am I still here?I don't understand it. 

To start off, I successfully took my own life 4 years ago in mid-February. This was at a large student party. I was not a student of this college nor did I know anyone other than the person that invited me. The student housing we were in was about an hour and a half away from my home. That night I took the local high-speed train up to the dorms where the party was. I planned on not going home. The party started out slow, eventually picking up as the night had gone on. I was making my own drinks. It took roughly an hour of sloshing back screwdrivers to have me wanting to vomit. The alcohol, the acid, and the sugar were coming up. I stumbled into the bathroom inside the small two bedroom dorm. Once in there, I vaguely remember lifting the toilet seat to puke. Next thing, I woke in a hospital bed really needing to piss. I jolted up out of fear and not knowing how the hell I got there, only to see my father sitting next to my hospital bed. He told me the details of what happened after my memory went blank. I had fallen over in the bathroom, hit my head, and proceeded to choke on my vomit until I stopped moving. The guy that invited me to the party noticed I was missing and found me dead in the bathroom. He picked me up and began trying to resuscitate me, even through my vomit covered face/torso. He yelled to one of the other party goers to call the paramedics; they arrived within 4 minutes. Thanks to the guys attempt at reviving me, it kept oxygen and blood flow going long enough for the paramedics to bring me back. I'll never be able to live this down. 

But my question is, why? Why did he have to keep me going? I just wanted to die. I knew what I was doing that night. I didn't want to return home. 

I have nightmares about this still. I wish I was dead. I don't want to redo it. It was so painful to begin with. I have to retry soon. I can't keep continuing to think my life has any value.",suicide
347766,"nothing interestingI‚Äôve been restless, some days and some nights I think I know, but I don‚Äôt know. I have come to believe I‚Äôm afflicted by many kinds of mental illnesses, drawn to the fact that i would love to be someone great, I‚Äôd love to be someone who is successful and one that shares the wealth that comes with. I don‚Äôt understand much and I‚Äôve succumbed to a lot of uncharacteristic behaviors, I have lost all interest in education, I exploit my family for my own interests that seem to be reaching no value, I‚Äôve stolen many times, cash behind their backs justifying it for their negligence and lack of attention towards me and it hurts my pride, especially in the circumstance for all that they do for me, they put food on the table, they work all night, they do their best to understand my situation, since we‚Äôre a first generation family. I also have great pride in my culture, my parents are Chinese and I would be more than sad and disappointed if I let their expectations down and as I also had expectations to take care of them, but I feel so pressured by my fear, I feel so misunderstood, I feel so guilty, I feel very young and naive, I feel like I probably shouldn‚Äôt feel anything, I feel nihilistic all the time. I‚Äôve had a lot of great friends and great memories, my heart falls out when I reminisce about my high school days. I was supposed to graduate a couple months ago but I think I need help? Of course I don‚Äôt hold anything against anyone, I hold this grudge against myself for not being able to change, I am stubborn, I am prideful, I won‚Äôt let anyone help me, I desire admiration but I don‚Äôt seek it for bad intention. I believe I‚Äôm talentless, but perhaps I tell myself that as an excuse to let myself fail and be okay with it. I‚Äôve been alone a lot and i escape reality myself and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be able to recover. I have it a lot in my head that plenty of people have it way worse than I do and that‚Äôs of course true but I have no doubt in that the same could be said that it‚Äôs because no one cares that all these people have shitty lives. This could be noted as some cry for help but again my head refuses to acknowledge it as so and even writing such is difficult. I also have gone off lots of drugs and alcohol and I‚Äôm sure I have years of addiction and I‚Äôm only 18 and I‚Äôm sure I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt be such a degenerate but I didn‚Äôt care anymore. I‚Äôve managed to gain somewhat of a sense of humor and I‚Äôve learned to enjoy while it lasted. I have a lot of time to reflect about the past, and to think about the present, and plan for the future. Guess I have been too alone but that‚Äôs not the problem is it? My fears have grown far beyond rational and whoever reading this I have more than enough time and energy to explain but I wouldn‚Äôt bother, under the belief no one really cares anymore. Life has many choices and many people choose to be bad, fate I believe is what predetermines a life and I‚Äôve come close to taking control of my own and ending it, giving myself the self justice i deserve. And then I‚Äôll just collapse and everything I‚Äôll have left over will crumble to dust and fade away, and humanity will still run its course with the strong still living and the weak being a supplement to those superior. My family, friends and love interest will be more than devastated, I know for sure cause they‚Äôd want to know why and the worst feeling probably is to tell them I don‚Äôt know or leave them no answer at all. Suicide has always been away from me, but it‚Äôs more that i wish I didn‚Äôt exist anymore after all my sadness, collectively i can feel all those moments like scars, reminding me like a beating heart. I refute help cause I believe I don‚Äôt need any, that I am powerful enough to will myself into a better condition.

I really did realize how unhappy I am with everything. I have great ambition but I just don't feel like I can accomplish it. Memories flooded me about all the great times me and my ex had. my brain was being filled with all the times I had made my brother smile and tell each other how important we are to each other. He called me the other night and hinted a lot of things. Some of which a lot of us can relate to. 

In this moment of pure euphoria. It turned to darkness. I started to full out ball crying on the ground in emotional pain. The suffering is to great. I have no reason to live. The two most important people in my life want nothing to do with me(My ex) or are going to kill theirself.. Why do I even push on ward? Chances are I won't make it through life without my brother. He's the reason i'm alive today. When i was ODing in a suicide attempt he called 911. I'm such a selfish prick. Everyone has been so good to me and treated me right and nothing I do matters.

When I was 16 it started to get bad. I fought constant depression and anxiety silently because I felt like if I told someone they would just think I wanted the meds or I was just trying to get attention plus I have gone my whole life feeling like the things I say are just annoying people, I feel like I am a canker everyone's existence and that people are better off without me.


As it's progressed I went from contemplating suicide once every few weeks to thinking about it everyday. I just feel like I am ruining everybody's life, including my own, if I don't. I cry for seemingly no reason because I don't want to tell people that I'm thinking about suicide. The thought of ending my life doesn't make me happy but life doesn't make me happy either. I don't even have a lot to be upset about; I have a good home life, I have a boyfriend that loves me, I got accepted into the college of my dreams but none of that seems to matter and it makes me feel worse.



I get really upset for what seems like nothing and I can't help it. The smallest piece of stress will cause me to jump straight into a suicidal mindset. I think about killing myself when I'm at school, at home, at work, in the car... Everywhere. I have written note after note trying to build the courage to just end it but I can't. So all I'm asking is that someone can give me some advice on how to tell my mom (I still live at home) because I don't want to hurt her but I also want to stop hurting myself by not getting help.

347834,"I was supposed to die on January 24... [X-post from r/offmychest]... But I'm still alive.

I was supposed to get hit by the train. A suicide.

I have never actually feared my own death. I have thought about it alot but seen it as something bad. Everyone dies sooner or later and it's not something that is possible for anyone to avoid so why are people so afraid to die?

I thought I was ready... But now I have realized that I'm not so different from other people.

She havn't done anything wrong. You can ask anyone that knows her and they would all answer the same. She's innocent. An angel as pure as the first snowfall of the year. Why would she, of all people, deserve that the person she loves, the person she wants to spend her future with, took his own life. And all because she was too afraid to love him. Too afraid of what her parents would think. They already hated him. And they didn't even have a reson to hate him. They said that a reason wasn't needed... She can't and won't see him.

That letter I sent to her... 'I love you... And I understand that you can't see me, but I'm too stubborn... I will never give you peace as long as I live. So for both our sakes... I will take my life so that you can live on a better life...' How could I even think that would have been good. ""I love you so much I want to kill myself for you""? I don't deserve her... To be with her... To love her...

But at that time this seemed to be the only option. And I was determined. That day... January 24th... Was supposed to be the day of my death.

I gave my friend the letter... Told her to bring it to 'that' person. Without knowing the context of the letter she agreed. Meanwhile, I and another friend, my closest friend, decided that we would go and spend the lunch break at an nice place we both like. McDonalds. And we had something special with us. Two examples of his favorite beer. Arriving at McDonalds, I decided that at least my friend would have a bit of enjoyment so I payed for the meals. On our way we went a little detour. That detour passed the railroad. The place of my death.

I asked him about the time. 11.40. 15 minutes before the train arrives. 'Let's drink them now' I said. As we stood there I only had her in my mind. She was the only thing that had been in my mind that day. He looked at me as if he already knew what I was going to say. I told him. About her, about the letter and that at this day and at this place I am going to die. I had enjoyed my last beer and my last meal together with my best friend. What a fitting act before my death. He said that if I wouldn't come back with him he would beat the living shit out of me. Heh... We both know that was not going to happen. He isn't the kind of person to harm a friend, even in this kind of scenario. But he wouldn't need to.

The bells were ringing. It was time. But there was something wrong. I was trembling... My hands and my legs were shaking.I wanted to run away from there. As far away as possible. I was afraid. Afraid of what was coming. For the first time in my life... I was afraid of death.
Why..? Of all the times to be afraid. Why now... I was already standing on the railroad with my friend trying to drag me away. I could se the traind coming closer by the second. I could hear it loud and clear. I stepped aside and watched the train pass us by.

How could this be? I was so determined. I was supposed to die! Why was I alive? The train was supposed to run over me. I was supposed to die...
With tears in my eyes I smashed my fist into the ground. I was furious, but also happy. I was screaming in misery, but also relieved.
What have I done... I have scared my best friends, all my teachers in my school. And her... I am despicable. I am trash that only have brought pain and agony to the people that actually matter to me. How am I supposed to look them into the eyes now... After all I had done.

It is now sunday as I'm writing this... I have lived 4 more days than I was supposed to. And I am going to see them all tomorrow... I don't know how it will go... I wasn't expecting this, so I don't know.

We've been together for almost two years and it has been a lot of downs and ups. Between physical fights and hurtful arguments, bumps and bruises, mental and psychological scarring, we managed to love each other And try to make the best of it.  
 
A month ago I started having panic/anxiety attacks because of all the things we've been through to the point of my mother coming to get me from her house. The moment she needed me the most I went home. The moment she needed me my mother told her that homosexuality is a sin which caused her to sink even deeper. (My family is Jamaican and deeply rooted in Christianity) 

My girlfriend suffers from PCOS, being hearing impaired (and her hearing is currently getting worse), scalp psoriasis and sebhorric dermatitis. She is the only androgynous, heavily tattooed, biracial (black and Filipino), hearing impaired lesbian in her family and her family ignores her and doesn't make her feel like she's there. On top of that she's an only child and her parents don't even really give much of a damn about her and I've seen it first hand. 

She feels so alone on a daily basis because everyone that has ever been in her life has done her wrong. People she's called best friends, cousins, girlfriends, have taken advantage of her and used her and dragged her name through the mud to the point of her isolation. The point of where she can't keep a steady job 

Her biggest fear is her being alone for the rest of her life. She feels like she doesn't have a place anywhere. She feels like this is the life she's destined to live and she's scared and she wants to end it all. I've had to monitor her when she takes pills because she's overdosed before. 

I slipped up by only thinking of myself and thinking that she didn't need me because of all the things we went through and how she made me feel. I didn't think she loved me that much. I ignored her crying for me before I left and the day I left. 

I feel like utter crap. We have been unemployed for months because of our mental states. We have bills that are so backed up that our car might get repossessed, we've just lost the car insurance and or phone bills are way behind. I'm swimming in medical bills and her entire life is on the line. 

I feel helpless and I've added on to her loneliness when all I wanted to do was be her all and to be her family. I've in turn made her feel like how everyone has made her feel.

I have asked for medical care or a doctor to check my feet because walking hurts a lot, it had been 3 days and nothing.I am back home now for 2 days.

My tendons and ankles have gotten swollen. I can barely walk. I am getting suicidal and desperate. I dont know how long i can keep it together.

I have the right, under UN and EU, as well as my country to object due to personal beliefs.

Also, my battalion/company/whatever , is way tougher than the rest in the country, we come second to special forces only. No matter how hard we try we get shitted on by the people above us. 

I object attending because i do not want to kill a person, do not wish to hold a gun that *can* kill a person, can not live without humility, can not let go of who i am and become part of the machine that has and will keep killing people, because i can not just lose touch with my friends, my family, my girlfriend, because i am a person and i deserve to get treated as such, because i do not with to become ~~a man~~ the man they want me to be.

* Not allowed to work on public sector
* Not allowed to get a driver's license in the country
* Not allowed to vote
* Social stigma

347873,"About to give up, just found out my mother with alzheimers never loved meI'm 15, Female. During the pandemic I look after my mom and everything to do with her when my dads not home (giving her food and drinks, making sure she's okay). She's advanced to a stage where she can't talk properly anymore. 

For the past few weeks I've been feeling extremely suicidal, before the pandemic I was already so depressed that I was missing weeks of school, and there was nobody at home to force me to go so I'd just stay at home with my mom. My motivation for work is severely lacking to the point where I'll feel like crying just from looking at work I need to do. So right now im months behind school (not even including all the work they've set online during the pandemic)

So the other day I thought ""I'll just do all of my work for art, because that's something that I don't need any of the months of lessons to be able to do"". And I started writing down all of the things I need to do.

Skip forward to today. I went downstairs for some reason (I think to ask him to help with my work) and we ended up talking about my mom. And I mentioned something about how she always used to play with other kids but would rudely refuse to play with me. I said it was probably because her alzheimers was developing.

This is when my dad hits me with a bomb. When she had me, she had postpartum depression, and because she was stubborn and furiously independent she refused to get help with it or even acknowledge there was anything wrong with her. So, she never became attached to me, and then she started developing alzheimers. So she never started loving me.

My whole life, the one thing keeping me sane was that at least I knew that my mom loved me. Because my dads become depressed and irritable recently and it seems like he hates me sometimes. And I've just found out that she never loved me, at all, for any of my life. 

She used to push me into walls when I was little, and blame me for everything, and always take my brothers side in arguments. I don't even know how to ride a bike because she'd always refuse to take me out to do it. And I always thought that it must've just been alzheimers. But all of this was back when the only signs of her alzheimers was that she'd forget her keys sometimes. So she just hated me. All my life I've thought she loved me, but she hated me. 

And im just, struggling to see the point in living in a world where I don't even have the chance to have a connection with her. If she just hated me then I could try to fix it, but I can't because of her alzheimers. I just... Its all too much for me.",suicide

347900,"I'm 19 and I've already had enough of this lifeHi,

I'm a 19yo European girl. I'm supposed to start university this year. But I'm not looking forward to it at all...
The thing I miss the most is my childhood. I miss the times when nobody expected me to behave ""responsibly"", when I was cared for and could just have fun. I also wasn't aware of all the bad things in this world.¬†
I've never said I wanted to become adult, mature and responsible. I feel so helpless because nothing could be done about this.
I'm so young, yet I feel the best years of my life are gone.
I feel like there's no such university degree, no such job that could give me happiness. There's nothing that could bring my childhood back.
The thought of functioning in ""adult world"", dealing with career, insurances, doctor appointments etc. makes me SICK. I'm also petrified when I think I'll have to take care of my parents when they're very old.

I've always had practically no social life. People said I was a shy kid. But that wasn't a big problem because adults did things for me. Now any interaction with a stranger gives me anxiety.¬†
When I look at my peers or other people, I feel I'm so ""wrong"" and out of place that I'll never be able to live a normal life. I feel useless. People at my age have jobs, serious relationships, plans for the future.

I don't have a social life, but I don't feel lonely. It frustrates me that many people think one can be happy only around others.

Sometimes I also feel a sort of guilt - I know many people have gone through traumatic experiences, like domestic abuse, sexual harassment or toxic realtionships. I've been brought up in a safe, friendly environment, getting almost all things I wanted, yet I feel depressed, anxious and helpless.

Everything's OK as long as I'm isolated in my own world. My fave activities are reading, listening to music and playing video games.¬†(The world in games is so simple and restricted. I love it that I can have everything under control.)

But almost each time I have to step out of my safe space and do something in the real world, I feel nervous and upset. This wasn't a trouble when I was a little girl - it's understandable that a child can have their own world.

There are times at which I think about ending it all. But I know my family love me and would be absolutely devastated (which I find a bit ridiculous because I don't think I present much value).

I think that if I am to have even bigger problems when I'm older, I prefer to die now because there's no way I can cope with the troubles of adult life.

I'm sorry if this post is a little chaotic. Also, English is not my first language, so sorry if there are mistakes.

You put me down so low. We are supposed to go to Austin but I'm so scared to go with you because last time we went, you escalated a fight to a point of no return and kicked me out of your sister's apartment and when things cooled down the next day (I had no where to fucking go when I left) you told me to go home and find a way back to dallas.

I hope you go back to your meth selling ex and get stuck in that trap. 

You bring so much pain in my life. So much darkness. You have pushed me to the point of having manic attacks like when I was a child.

347910,"My head is finally clear - Suicide is the path I am takingI am a 23 years old woman. I was born in the 90s. 

As a kid, I was happy, but since the beginning of my teenage years ( 2006- ), I don't know why, I started to feel completely disconnected with my life.

I don't even want to blame the world anymore. I'm not saying this is anyone's fault. Somehow I am just not compatible with this and for the past 10 years I've been trying to figure it out, but I have found nothing worth living for and I am just sincerely and utterly bored with this game.

This is not the place I said I always wanted to live in. 
And honestly, I don't know what's wrong. Except the fact that I have nothing in my life, only money. That is what my parents always considered important and I was just not that type of person who could use it to my advantage, I guess. I've never played the role of the rich kid, others do a better job at it. I simply just miss all the things that I don't have, which are the following :

* time with my parents - whenever times I asked them for more time in my teenage years, they were busy. I went to a school where I had so much homework every day that I felt overwhelmed by it, I spent all my time inside and my social relationships went to  the trash. When you stay isolated for a long time, you start to become awkward, even if you weren't awkward before. Besides awkwardness, I was also lonely, scared and quite depressed most of my teenage years. I remember staying at the window often times in the winter evenings, after I finished my homework, and looking outside in the darkness, waiting for my mother to come home. I felt an utter misery inside myself and I couldn't explain why, I just got used to that there is no escape. It kinda became normal after a while, it was my daily routine. 

* friends - as I explained, in my previous point, in my early teenage years friends kinda disappeared because of schoolwork, and then simply because I got so used to living on my own and to being so depressed that I didn't have any drive to connect with people at all. 
Somewhere in my late teen years I started connecting with people again and I even made friends, only to discover that the world has changed so much. People nowadays stay on their phones all their long, browse social media, are very superficial, do not care about having deep conversations or whatever, anything that I consider important. But instead they hold very dearly all those things that I consider completely irrelevant. 
So even though I had friends, I discovered I don't want them. The time spent with them is so meaningless and boring like the time I spend on my own. 

* body: yes, I have been alienated from my body since my early teen years. The fact that in this period I started to feel that no one loves me was probably connected with the dysfunctional relationship I started to have with my body. I had eating disorders all the time, I was obsessed and abusive toward my body all the time, thinking that if I would just change it then people would love me more, but no matter how much I changed it, I could never end up loving it, not even liking it. Living 10 years in a body you hate is quite a strange thing, let me tell you. I always got overwhelmed and paranoid when I was around people, because this is how you feel when you hate yourself. 

* college/career: well due to my depression I wasn't truly in the mindset to discover my passion, so I am in Medical school. I thought that I will end up liking it, but I didn't. I guess my depression doesn't truly allow me to like anything at all. Because I can't ever truly focus. In the back of my mind, there is always the idea of self-destruction. Everything else fades away compared to my strong desire to end my existence. 

* sanity : yes, I was a bright and balanced kid, but that is over since a long time. No matter how hard I try to pull myself together, I feel that my sanity is falling apart every single day. I did a quite good job for 10 years, most people wouldn't tell that I am suicidal or depressed at all, they know me as a joyful and energetic person, because I always overcompensated my real self with acting like the person I would like to be, the person that I once was. 

I am losing my sanity because of all the regrets that I have in this life. I could have been so different from how I turned out to be. And I don't truly know why. And it doesn't even matter anymore. I lost 10 years of my life and I feel so empty and so disappointed of myself.

I am losing my sanity because I feel I was broken at a young age and no matter how much I tried for the last 10 years, I couldn't heal myself from that. 

I am losing my sanity because I had to abuse my body with sugar, caffeine, alcohol just to get by, just to turn off my brain for a while so that I don't kill myself instantly. The desire to live a healthy lifestyle comes from having a strong reason to be healthy and to live. Well, I don't have such a reason. I think I abused myself because I subconsciously didn't care if I die from an overdose. 

I am losing my sanity because I cannot connect with people anymore, because I feel like an alien in this world. 

I am losing my sanity because of all the enthusiasm I once had inside myself for this life, but that I can't feel anymore, because I am way too messed up now. 

I am losing my sanity because most of the ideas that I have are not compatible with this world and I'm not the type who adapts to survive. I tried to adapt and I didn't think that is worth it. Even when I played the game of life according to the rules, I have found out I don't want to play the game anymore.

On Friday I went out with one of my friends to take a walk in the city. I was drinking a few beers and while I was walking and listening to my friend, a sudden realization hit me : I felt an extremely clear and strong reason to end this life. I didn't even feel any emotions attached to it, I just felt like my head is finally clear and I can finally see clearly what I got to do. 

I do not want to be a burden for anyone anymore. I know my parents wanted me to turn out differently and they would have liked a different child. Well, I would have wanted a different family also. It's all messed up. There's no point in continuing this anymore. 

As for my friends  - well, they won't miss me so much. After some time they will forget. This is how it goes, I have seen it happening to others. Relationships aren't too deep nowadays anyway. So it won't matter much.

347930,"""If you were really suicidal [...]""Am I not?

Have I not told you all the methods and each fucking way they could fail, like a mantra, each and every one, found during hours upon hours of crying in front of my laptop screen.  
I have told you, over and over how done I am. I have told so many. But! I am a logical person! I know all that could go wrong if I were to try!

That's the only reason I haven't killed myself yet. Because if I were to try, I know it'd fail and make my life even worse.

I am not lucky enough to get any reprieve from this hell.  
Why should I?  
Why should I finally after years upon years of depression, anxiety, phobias and an abusive household, after all of that, after all the years of being told ""you're a psycho."" ""you should be put in a ward"" ""just kill yourself"" by my own parents-  
Why should I finally. Pass away?

Not even the psychologists or people around me feel like I'm worth helping!

""If you were really suicidal, we'd keep you stationary.""

Stationary, away from my parents who hate me. But why should you. You couldn't even answer to the mail I sent after spiking suicide intention due to wrong antidepressants.  
""I forgot to mention I was on holiday.""  


I just wish dying was easier. I don't even think humanity can change and that people would start giving a damn about their peers. Why should they. They've probably been wronged just the same.

The last thing I remember was laying on my stairs, looking at my cat and thinking how amazing he looks, how nature is beautiful. Suddenly I have obscured flashes of consciousness. I saw an IV needle in my arm, I saw my dad, with long hair and a purple plaid sweater. Darkness, then light again. The nurse walks in and informs my parents that they had found marijuana in my system, it was no surprise to them. For whatever reason, it didn't worry me. I'd say it's because I was about to fucking die. Suddenly I wake up in my bed, the familiar room in which I've spent so much time becoming who I am. This room
Is me, and I am this room. The familiarity of such a setting, along with my mother and step dad around, gave me enough comfort to forget what had just happened.

347940,"It‚Äôs getting pretty hard to get everything out of my head.I want to end my life really bad, it‚Äôs been getting a lot worse the last few months. I smoke a lot of weed, which is probably making me really depressed, or at least contributing. I had these feelings before I picked up the habit. 

I‚Äôm currently writing this in the bathroom at work, sobbing silently while someone‚Äôs dropping a massive deuce in the next stall over. That‚Äôs pretty funny, but anyways here‚Äôs the point:

Ever since I was a young teenager (i‚Äôm currently 18), I‚Äôve had no more motivation. I don‚Äôt do anything, I don‚Äôt want to do anything, I want nothing. I feel worthless and hard to love, I‚Äôm lazy as hell because I never want to do anything, which turns into me calling into work. I‚Äôm lucky that I can do that at my full time job and not have to pay rent, but now I have no absences left to take. 

So I‚Äôm crying in here, all pathetic like, at work, because I can‚Äôt call in anymore, and I can‚Äôt take the stress of being here while I‚Äôm feeling these feelings. I‚Äôve skipped school all through G10-12, and now I call into work any chance I get. How come I‚Äôm such a scumbag? How come I can‚Äôt deal with a normal 9-5 Mon-Fri? That‚Äôs a normal thing to do. People have jobs and don‚Äôt complain. They don‚Äôt call in. How come I absolutely must? Why don‚Äôt I have the motivation to get through ONE DAY without doing this stupid shit. There‚Äôs nothing left to me. I‚Äôm literally a husk, no more life in me. I can‚Äôt stop myself, I have no control over my decisions. I want what I want, and I get what I want no matter what, and I feel like an absolute piece of shit, and a waste. I have for years. 

I used to think suicidal people just want attention and that they‚Äôre drama queens. Can you believe that? Now look at me lol. I‚Äôm an absolute mess. Maybe I deserve it for that. I‚Äôve been to therapy. I have no identification to get prescribed anything right now, as I just moved in with my S/O not long ago from out-of-province. 

I‚Äôm literally in the bathroom pretending to be sick so I can go home. I‚Äôm pathetic. This is low. I don‚Äôt want to be this person. I‚Äôm stuck, feels like I have no where to go. 

I‚Äôm not going to end my life, at least not any time soon. I just want to talk to someone about this. I need it out of my head. I hope someone can at least relate. I can‚Äôt be alone. I don‚Äôt know what I would do if I was alone in feeling this. 

Tldr; I have no control over my actions, although I‚Äôm completely aware of what I‚Äôm doing. I have no self control, no motivation, and because of that I think low of myself and want to end my life. Hope someone can relate. I‚Äôve been reading posts here and have found lots to relate to.

347952,"The funniest joke you‚Äôll hear today 
Assuming you are healthy, your heart when working normally, acts sort of like a pump, or rather two pumps, you see your right heart expands to draw deoxygenated blood in from the body, and contracts to pump it out to the lungs to become oxygenated. And at the same time, your left heart draws in oxygenated blood from the lungs and then pumps it out to your stupid, misshapen body. Now sometimes, irregularities can occur that prevent your heart from pumping properly. ""congestive heart failure"", is an interesting one. Say, your heart loses some of its contractile force due to high blood pressure, for example, this will result in the pooling of blood in your left heart, or left ventricle chamber, and in response to this, the cells in your left ventricle will enlarge to push against the higher circulatory resistance caused by the increase in blood pressure, which is a great solution, but only in the short term. Much like your parents' decision to try to save their marriage by having, well, you. But because of these enlarged cells, the left ventricle chamber then becomes much smaller, resulting in less blood being able to fill into it and because the blood coming into the left ventricle has nowhere to go, it begins to back up into the lungs and from there, because it's all a cycle, it'll back up into the right heart and then, you've got congestive heart failure on your hands. Not \*weird swallow\* unlike, how the incessant, heated disagreements between your timeworn mother and father is also, on your hands. The name ""congestive"" heart failure, though, is apt because fluid then leaks into your alveolar air spaces making it difficult to breathe, and with all this, blood pressure increases, yet again, and the original hypertrophy of muscle cells in your left ventricle is no longer a help, and since the contractile force of your heart has decreased, it certainly can't pump against the new, much higher resistance  and because of that, your body, in response to the heart not pumping sufficient blood, thinks: ""Well gee golly, ha, I mustn't have enough fluid!"" so it tells your kidneys then, to return any liquid you take in, meaning you'll retain a lot more water, which has to go somewhere, so it leaks into your legs, abdomen, and all over the body, and can result in the gaining of 2-3 pounds, per day! Which, as you can imagine, will cause rapid accumulation of total body weight and after just one month, someone afflicted by this disease could amass up to 100 extra pounds! There is effectively no way that a human being could gain weight at this rate, by which any other mechanism.

347968,"The surprising part is the staggering depth of pain a person can experience.Welp, I did it again. Once again I've managed to place myself squarely in a position or true, honest, complete solitude. Actual aloneness. It's something I've experienced before. I was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago, I don't have it any more but at the time my doctors told me I was going to die soon. I was only 17 and not emotionally ready for the diagnosis or the prognosis. In response I shut out the world and didn't speak to another human for over a year. It was horrific and traumatizing, I'd told myself I'd never let my self isolating tendencies get so bad again. That I'd never allow myself to be alone again. Turns out it's a bit unavoidable when you're a disgusting inept leech like me. I spent a year or so recently, holed up in my room working from home and doing some odd home repair type jobs for ends meet. the majority of my friends were online. I made a mistake then, because I met someone incredibly special and I learned what it's actually like to have someone close to you. I didn't grow up with a good family you can draw your own conclusions as to how bad it was and despite the fact that I was fully in my mid twenties by the time I met this person I'd really never experienced actual real closeness. Well I ruined that, and whatever other internet friends I had because, plainly, it was the internet and I'd found some prospects in real life.so I packed my bags and moved cross country with someone new only to find myself in an extremely emotionally abusive relationship that has now deadened into me not leaving because I've got nowhere to go and them not telling me to leave because I have no idea.  At first I was surprised but pretty resilient to them telling me they hated me, and to kill myself, and whatever other horrible thing they could think of. But it's worn me down and honestly they're not really wrong. They don't mean it fully I think, at least most of the time. I think it's a facade, something they think is mildly humorous that they use defensively to avoid ever having a genuine conversation.""edgy humor"" Which I suppose makes things simpler considering how self deluded they are about who I am and the things I do. Not to put too much emphasis on them, understand that they are only a tiny piece to a large picture. The reality is, I'm 26 now, I'm old, Ive got no friends or family, I've got no one and nothing, and I think I deserve it. I think considering this has been most of what I've experienced in my life, this solitude and lonesomeness coupled with the fact that I can't find regular work due to a huge collaiope of beurocratic bullshit that would make you suspect a government conspiracy against me makes me think that the only thing that's left to do is just kill myself. Even in the event I do manage to get work so I can afford to leave this place it's not like it would be better, I'd just be grinding my skin off bit by bit at the slave mills so I can afford to get into debt. It's hard to articulate how much it hurts and how little I can do about it. I just sit here as the days whiz by occasionally crying or punching a wall until.my knuckles bleed. For years I knew it would come to this but I can feel now that it's unavoidable. I really just have to kill myself so I can stop fucking up and stop hurting people and stop leeching and stop feeling this unimaginable void of pain drowning me every second of every day. I used to think I'd be a writer, I can conceive of great beauty and even when I was very young I enjoyed the process. That's gone now, I hope whoever finds the short stories and poetry I've written has heart enough to destroy them instead of parading them around as one last testament to the fact of my failure as a human. I'm sorry this is so rambling I'm just exhausted, I hate to complain about my life as though I have things any worse than anyone else. I don't want to feel sorry for myself and to a large extent I don't, but if I were to list all the things that fuck me up and detract from my ability to interact with other people properly it would be a long one.

I really need to let this out and this seemed like the most appropriate sub for it
It was my boyfriend's birthday last night, some of his friends from his home town came down to the city and we went on a pub crawl with roughly 10 mates. 
Everyone was pretty drunk or high, and I just felt this wave of doom spread over me. I was quite all night which is very unlike me because i am usually a very loud, enthusiastic person. 
Everyone was having a great time and because i didnt want to bring anyone else down i acted like i was okay and went along with it. My 3 best friends kept telling me how much they loved me and cared for me, and would keep checking on me which made me feel loved. 
Fast forward to the early hours of the morning, we went back to the apartment i booked for us all to stay. I decided it was a great idea to stand on the balcony, 31 floors above ground and stare at the sky. I was out there for a long time, and the only thing running through my mind was to jump off. As soon as i was about to stand on the chair and i guess jump, my boyfriend came outside and stood with me. He put his arm around me in the cold and just stood there. After 5 minutes, he turned around to me and told me he loved me (this is the first time he has said that to me since we've been together) and i said it back. He then went on about how much i mean to him etc and i started crying. I hugged him and told me i loved him, but then the mood changed because one of our mates had to leave.
Later on, everyone kinda just crashed everywhere and my boyfriend's best friend ended up sleeping next to my boyf, leaving me to sleep on the very small couch. I was really mentally unstable so i had a joint and took double of my medication and slept. 
The next morning everything was fine and we all left all happy n shit
But now im sitting in my car, almost angry at myself for not just jumping off. 
The problem is though, that i know how much i am loved and how much I'm worth. I know life is worth it, i know suicide is not the answer
But i want to die. I KNOW that i will be missed, i have the best friends, and an even better family, and a caring boyfriend, i know how much it'll affect all of them and specially me. But i really just want to fucking die. I'm very tempted to overdose on insulin tonight.

I used to vent through art, or writing, but I have no desire for either anymore. I used to read all the time, but I can‚Äôt focus on anything anymore for more than a minute. Life these days feels like it‚Äôs saturated in darkness.

347996,"I don't see the point in living anymore.I was diagnosed with clinical depression two years ago after I failed at killing myself (I was 17 at the time), and went through the standard myriad of medications and therapy, none of which worked. The past two years have been spent trying to distract myself from reality, usually unsuccessfully. Despite still being generally unhappy, I had managed to hold onto my convictions and keep a vague hope that the future would be better up until last month. Since then I've started reading about nihilism and questioning if there's even a point to continue living.

Nothing that previously mattered to me does anymore. I used to care about people, at least in theory, and I was a vegetarian and supported animal rights. Now it all seems futile since everything will die anyway. I've found myself completely ambivalent to the suffering and death of others. I've gone from complete pacifism to wanting to inflict harm on my college roommates, where I was able to tolerate them previously. I can't even enjoy my old methods of escape anymore.

I guess me typing this out means at least a part of me wants to not die, or just be proven wrong that suicide is the best option. But I don't see how it isn't. I keep coming back to wanting to not exist, to just escape from this shitty reality. Beyond that, I fail to see a purpose in life. I refuse to delude myself into thinking we have a creator, and as such we lack a specific design. Without that, and knowing everything will at some point in the future cease to exist, all we have is this miserable and brief life where we are under constant control from other, more powerful people. People powerful enough to decide for me that I don't have enough control over my own life to end it. That seems ludicrous to me. It feels like if I don't even have that right, I'll always be under somebody else's control. This line of thought always ends with me just wanting to escape it all through death.

While I've been wasting my time contemplating existence, I've had real life bearing down on me. My grades have slipped to just barely passing, and I have a lengthy term paper due next week I haven't started and I have no idea how to finish. My parents are pressuring me to get a summer job, despite me doubting I'm hirable, and I have no idea how I'll pass my exams. I hate my college, but I don't think I have the grades to transfer out, and have missed the application deadlines for next fall. Best case scenario, I manage to leave the country by transferring to a Canadian university next spring, but I doubt it will happen. I'm assuming I'll be stuck in my birth state which I completely loathe. I have nothing to look forward to except the next time I can get drunk.",suicide

348002,"I miss you little bro.I never thought in a million years I‚Äôd lose a loved one to suicide. The day I found you slumped in our backyard woods haunt me day and night. How can someone so gentle and kind who loved life and wouldn‚Äôt hurt a soul be the one to end their own lives. Everytime I think of you tears begin to fall down my eyes. My baby brother I‚Äôm deeply sorry that big brother couldn‚Äôt save you and for that I‚Äôll always live with the guilt that I could‚Äôve done more. I know it‚Äôs not my fault but I can‚Äôt seem to convince myself. It felt unreal seeing you at the funeral home. I sobbed and mourned unable to keep the hurt inside when I seen and touch your cold body. I ask you to please wake up if this was a joke because my mind couldn‚Äôt accept that you were really gone.

I can‚Äôt explain the pain I felt it was different from any other ones I‚Äôd felt. I remember your bright and beautiful smile like it was yesterday, but when I see you in your casket cold and lifeless my soul shattered and I begin to weep. I caress your body from head to toe feeling utter helplessness and hopelessness wishing this was all just a bad dream. I miss you terribly and I‚Äôm so lonely. The world seems to have simply moved on and here I am stuck and frozen still confused as to why you did what you did. The day you decided you were going to end your life you told me you loved me and I didn‚Äôt know why. I sensed something was wrong but couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. Now I know why and I‚Äôm deeply saddened that I didn‚Äôt say it back cause it was the last time I‚Äôll ever get to see you again. My baby brother the pain hurts and I wanna make it go away. I can‚Äôt let go and I don‚Äôt know how to. I wanna see you again and tell you that I love you, but it‚Äôs too late your gone. All I have left are regrets and guilt, shame and pain. 

The day has finally come it‚Äôs time to close the casket and say our last goodbye. The tears won‚Äôt stop falling and I‚Äôm unwilling to let you go. Desperate and wishful thinking I pray that somehow you‚Äôd wake up and say this was all just a prank. We closed your casket and my body started trembling. I and others help load your casket onto the black car and it was here that it started to really sink in, you‚Äôre really dead and this is it! Here we are at the cemetery preparing you your departure guiding you to your destination in the afterlife and taking one last good look before your lowered down and covered in dirt! The unbearable pain and ache in my heart if only you can feel it, the lonely desperate tears if only you can see it, and the cries and howls of my loss speak my love for you. I held your hand, kissed you on your forehead, and  said my farewells one last time before they take you away. As we pour the dirt and throw flowers over your coffin I‚Äôm dazed and lost in time. No words or tears will explain the heart wrenching pain I felt that day. Everything seems so unreal. My mind couldn‚Äôt process your death and I can‚Äôt seem to make it all go away.

It‚Äôs been 4 years since you took your life. Not a day goes by I don‚Äôt think of your funny personality and beautiful smile that lit up everyone mood. I keep asking why and still wonder if you‚Äôll come back knocking on the door. I go to the place where I found you and sat down thinking about what you were thinking before you decided to end it and mourn the lost all over again. When no ones home to hear me I cry for you, when I‚Äôm in the shower I silently cry for you, and when I dream about you I hold it tight and cherish it while tears are streaming down my face when I awake. I‚Äôm deeply sorry and wounded badly. I‚Äôm sorry that I couldn‚Äôt see it, I‚Äôm sorry that I couldn‚Äôt protect you, and I‚Äôm sorry big brother let you down. This is all to much and I‚Äôm tired. I want to close my eyes and drift away.  

Goodbye my baby brother pengchoua xiong, goodbye! You were so full of life, but the darkness consumed you and you finally let it go. Only 20 years old and a life still ahead, but you chose to go. I ain‚Äôt mad and I understand because you went through too much bullshit and others treated you like you weren‚Äôt a human being so for that I wish wherever you may be at that your in peace and not hurting anymore. Though I‚Äôm dying and torn to pieces I forgive you and hope that if heaven is for real I‚Äôd love to have the chance to see your beautiful face once again because I miss you terribly! It‚Äôs very painful bro I‚Äôd never imagine that I‚Äôd come visit my little baby brother at the cemetery instead of countries apart. Thank you for being part of my life and thank you for being my brother until then take care we will meet when my time is up. Rip pengchoua xiong!",suicide
348003,"Hoi hoi! Do you have itchy and easily irrated skin? Do you have eczema or a skin condition that makes your skin easily irratated? Wel i got good new for you bud! Im no doctor by any means, but i am a guy who has eczema, so i guess it applies too:

1. DRINK WATER. AND I MEAN A LOT OF WATER. Water is quite nescessary for the rehydration of the skin. Id say about an average of 8 glasses a day, or better yet, a glass every hour of the day to keep yourself refreshed and rehydrated.

2.Use Lotion that helps rehydrate the skin. This one is optional, since not all people can buy a skin moisturizer cause they are EXPENSIVE AS SHIT, but for those who can, i reccomend you buy it. Apply it about every time
after you take a shower or a bath.

3. Use Cold or warm water for bathing. It feels good, and irritates your skin less than hot water.

4.Sleeping Gloves(Optional) This is for the people who unconsciously scratch their skin while sleeping, so when they wake up it feels like they accidentaly Scuba dived in a Lava lake. Wearing gloves helps solve that issue by preventing you from doing too much damage on your skin, since the gloves are made of cloth.

348009,"Suicidal thoughts are relatively new to me, figured I would post hereThough I would post here because I have been thinking about it everyday for a few months. Option 1 is carry on like this forever. Option 2 is try to do things to better myself like get a new job, but thoughts like that give me a very violent ""I should just end it then"", because that stuff is just too hard for me, which takes me to option 3, suicide.

I don't actually want to die, not really, it's like my mind is going, ""well here is a way out, consider me"". The thoughts are pounding at the door so to speak and I am just kind of staying still and staring at the door. I wrote a suicide note yesterday and cried my eyes out for the first time in a while but I started getting really frightened that I was ""initiating a plan"" so I stopped. It was like looking through the keyhole of that door so to speak

I try not to indulge the thoughts cos they give me shivers and make me feel extremely guilty. I do my best to ignore them, sometimes they pop up briefly like a ""hey just do it"" in such a casual way I can just ignore them, sometimes at the stupidest things, I put the wrong coffee in my cup the other day and said to myself ""why the fuck havnt I done it yet"" and I had to argue with myself for a bit and tell myself to shut up repeatedly. Other times it is pretty deep and frightening where I feel like it is a legitimate choice. I feel that at this moment in time I can just keep going listening the the thoughts each day with a great amount of certainty that I wont right now. I can't control the thoughts but I let them brush over me with a ""not today demon"" sort of attitude, I can't really describe it

I am just scared that this is the start of something ya know? Scared it will get worse like many people here, scared I will actually truly want to die at some point. Like when I look to my future I see that I am dead by suicide but right now at this time I am not letting my thoughts push me over the edge, the influence of the thoughts haven't trapped me yet, ya know? Like I can be objective and rational and dispel them with distractions but the thoughts still scare me deeply. I can't get help or therapy, my anxiety is too great, so I am just doing what I can to make sure I stay in this sort of not a major risk phase which is to not indulge them, so no more writing suicide notes etc. I don't want to be the guy who kill myself like I see in the future.

348012,"My awful body brings me so much anguish. I've failed at every step of life.I'm 22. 10 years ago this month, I tried to kill myself for the first time.

""Just wait until you're older,"" someone tells me in kindergarten. They read me the ugly duckling.

Puberty starts. I'm taller than everyone I know, boys start calling me a giraffe. A few years later, my parents have too much to deal with, and they start calling me a cow when I become obese at 10. 

At 12, I attempt suicide. I try again at 13, 14 and 16. Eight months of my life have been inpatient. I try one more time at 18, and a day and a half later I wake up on my floor. I am obese, mannish, tall, stupid and anxious; a nightmare to witness.

Out of disgust, I adjust: mental illness and the successful ideal are opposites. I have to make up for the failures of my fried, adolescent mind. I go to college, I do well. Every day I pretend I'm capable, and every night I curl up and dig my nails into my own back. Two years into school, I run out of steam. My work suffers. I lose faith that I can ever be capable.

This year, I become bitter.

Lose weight? Fine. I foolishly mimick starvation and lose 100lbs in 9 months. It makes me sick. My fat body's skin hangs off of a thin frame. Nobody sees-- I'll never see my friends again, we're finishing our degrees online-- and nobody cares. 

I see myself today: a failed organism, writhing in desperation. No matter what I go through--loss, cruelty, abuse-- my simple failure to form overwhelms me. Quarantine and 8 months of complete isolation are the nails of my coffin. 

I'm way too wrecked to raise kids or succeed in my field. My line, from strong men and women who survived one of the most war-torn regions and periods in history, will end with me. It's hilarious that this is really all about wishing a guy would want me. If a man did care for me, I would be scared. I know I would fail him. You can never run from childhood mental illness. My rotten heart is contagious and I can't offer it.

Dozens of therapists, countless medications, nothing works.  I've spent the majority of my life hating myself. This is hell and I want to be free. In this life, I'll never be anything but a miserable, dumb, fat cow.",suicide

348016,"Here's a Dramatic Pre-Suicide NoteSex is my obsession, I‚Äôm a porn addict. I masturbate and watch pornography every day, often on multiple occasions throughout the day. It‚Äôs been this way since 7th or 8th grade. I need to masturbate or else I don‚Äôt feel normal, but it doesn‚Äôt cut it anymore. I need something real, I need to love something, someone. I‚Äôm never going to find it. I‚Äôm void of emotion and anything remotely human. I‚Äôm morbidly obese. I have acne and sores all over my body. My father has sores even worse than I, to the point where I‚Äôm concerned for his life and the possibility of lethal infection. Genetically, this tells me that my skin will only get worse. I don‚Äôt think anybody in the last 6 or 8 years has been attracted to me. Today I laid in bed from 11am to 3pm, just curled up repeating the phrase in my head, ‚ÄúI want to die,‚Äù over and over and over again. I‚Äôm so alone, I spend most of my time alone, most human contact is forced and involves some sort of transaction. I‚Äôve been lightly suicidal since the 7th or 8th grade. The idea has always been there, especially in rough times. I‚Äôve always had the feeling that I‚Äôm not good enough, in middle school I realized that suicide was an option, it was always there as a way out. The only girl that‚Äôs ever liked me is my current obsession. She liked me in middle school and I turned her down because I thought she was ugly. This is literally the worst mistake I‚Äôve ever made in my whole life. This person still and is currently in my life, and she‚Äôs by far the best thing in my life. I do anything I can to spend time with her, when I‚Äôm around her I feel calm and feel like I can tell her anything. I just want to do anything I can to make her feel loved and special, but she doesn‚Äôt want it. I‚Äôve told this person I liked her and found out she‚Äôll never view me as anything more than a friend/brother figure. I would marry this person in a second, I would go to the ends of the world for this person, but she has no intention of ever loving me or being attracted to me. I love her, but not enough to let her go I guess. God or the universe or maybe even luck gave me many chance for success in my early youth and I fucked it up. I feel like my whole life has been a series of missed opportunities. I had an opportunity to get a full ride scholarship for music and I turned it down to instead study science, yet another fuck up. Now I want to go to school for music, but I‚Äôm so rusty, I‚Äôll never be good enough. I can‚Äôt look at myself in the mirror. My life is constant anxiety and lethargic wasted time. I gave up on science in my studies at college. I hated it, I only did it to maybe someday get a good paying job. I‚Äôm planning on going to school for music, but I‚Äôll never be good enough to make a living off it. I don‚Äôt have the focus or intelligence to study anything. The only reason I can go to college is because it‚Äôs a business that does everything it can to make money, and my grandparents happened to be rich and willed me a lot of money for education. I have an amazing blessing that most people will never have, and I‚Äôve already fucked away 3 years of time and money; time and money that could have educated and benefited a worthier person. I didn‚Äôt plan on writing a suicide note, but I guess this is it. A few months ago, I was planning on killing myself with sleeping pills, mainly as a cry for help. I wanted to die, but also didn‚Äôt. I knew that I would either die, which might be nice, or gain the attention of anybody that loves me, which also might feel nice for a moment. I didn‚Äôt buy the sleeping pills because a lethal dosage cost $60. It‚Äôs funny that I‚Äôm so cheap that I would back out of a suicide attempt due to money alone. Ironically, I‚Äôm going to spend around $200 on a shotgun tomorrow to blow my brains out. I don‚Äôt want to put on a show anymore, I just want to leave this world. I really want to die, I‚Äôm ready to see what‚Äôs on the other side of this physical world and find out if I can leave this cycle and prison of life. I don‚Äôt want it anymore, I can‚Äôt handle it anymore. To all my friends and family, I‚Äôm truly sorry if I‚Äôve brought you any unwanted feeling or emotions, but this is my life and I didn‚Äôt want to live it anymore. This is no reflection against you all, I love you all very much and enjoyed every moment, I just couldn‚Äôt stand being around myself.

348019,"I just need someone to talk to right nowGoing to this subreddit just made me realize it really never can get better. I've been sad for as long as I can remember. I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks that have led to me ending up in a hospital from trying to hurt myself. I've tried calling friends and it's obviously too early and also probably nobody wants to deal with this shit.

Lastt night I went out dancing because I used to love it and it would always cheer me up. Instead I just had random men grabbing at me and trying to put their hands up my skirt and disgusting shit like that. I ended up crying in front of everyone and my friends took me home but it made me feel like a wuss who can't be taken anywhere. I didn't leave the house for a long time because I used to be terrified of people. That's how I feel again. I don't want to go outside because everyone is so horrible. Why should I want to live when I can't even be near strangers without having a breakdown? I know what other people are capable of, I've had much worse things happen to me. 

I don't have any coping skills. I don't know what to do when I start having a panic attack or how to even prevent it in the first place. I'm from a very small town and moved to a big city and still am not used to the crowds. It doesn't always scare me but when it does I become completely broken and useless. 

I've been in this state of mind before and it terrifies me. I have little moments of realizing what's happening and being fairly reasonable about it but then two minutes later I'm back to freaking out and crying and wanting to hurt myself. I shouldn't have been born. This has been a miserable existence. ",suicide

Naturally, I told my mother what I did, thinking it wasn't even that bad. She basically called me an idiot, a criminal even. She told me I should think before I act. I TRY.

All this happened too many times and every time I get so scared and sad, but this is the first time I actually drew blood. Not vertically. Not yet. I only did it because I felt the need to punish myself. I'm scared of death but I will never stop fucking shit up. I fuck up school, friendships, everything. Even now I have no way to hide the cuts so I'll have to explain myself.

The only person I could talk face-to-face about this is one of my teachers, but I'm terrified of approaching her. I don't know how to handle this anymore. It keeps getting worse every time but I can't help thinking of myself as a whiny, unappreciative bitch.

I try not to pull in friends or family into my bullshit despite what my best friend says. I have always been bouncy in recent years.  I generally put little regard in my own life in compare to others,  I overthink, social anxiety,  and doubt my own ability. Any stupid mistake I let hang and any attempts to try socialize outside my small group or online presence ends up making me feel even more left out afterward. 

But enough of that and let me explain the title. I have plan for longer than I'll admit to end it by age 30 if nothing really changed. I blame it on society for it ""don't have high position,  college education, and at least dating you are failure"". Oddly enough I did get somewhat high position In job and i guess somewhat until a month ago I thought i was dating someone. It was just simple, good guy just not the person for her.  Sure I can understand that,  but she made it sound that trying to make someone happy and ""successful""(yes bit vague but I don't want to do in details). Is wrong. Thing is I enjoy making people happy and lives easier for people I like. I could care less about my wellbeing. I'm nobody....I fucked up things badly when I got ""selfish"".

You are just getting rid of a chance of a good life- There is always another side to that coin. I guess that depends on how confident you are and/or how lucky and/or how much support you truly have in order to make a logical choice. A well thought out Pros and Cons lists helps one understand that.

Theres always a better option- maybe, regardless though, at least for people with depression, that feeling will remain and return someday. That is the feeling we would like to avoid more than a shitty situation.

Either I‚Äôm a snowflake, or my parents don‚Äôt believe in mental health.

I‚Äôve read too many stories about failed suicide attempts. That‚Äôs what my problem is.

348036,"Mental and social problems are killing meBackground : ( I am not a native so this might be a bit incoherent so bare with me )I am living in what is called an ""Islamic republic"" where relashionships are controlled by a lot of religious limitations therefore having any kind of sexual contact outside of marriage can lead to jail as it is considered a crime... I know rules over here are stupid and the only making of it is horny teens with a lot of psychological complications as talking about sexual needs or preferences is totally forbidden ( therefore laws created a homophobic society as even homosexuality is considered a crime and an illness :( ) hopefully I was raised by an open minded parents and I got to chose whether or not I wanted to be a Muslim ( I am not) the problem is u can't express this publicly as everyone is supposed to be Muslim :( . The point is am really frustrated and I feel like I don't belong in here and I am tired of pretending to believe in something that I don't believe in and added to some psychological problems I developed a lot of suidal thoughts.. main problem : I never had a girlfriend and even though sexual connection is forbidden but people are open enough to accept a relationship based on love ... I am a bit socially awkward and I tend to fail at creating any kind of significant friendship with girls ( luckily they are not all wearing the ""Islamic"" thing ) but I have a few good boy friends that I hang out with frequently and have a lot of good memories with . As puberty started affecting and in my journey of exploring myself I fell in love with this girl (A) she was cutely shy and she never talks with boys and as a never talker with girls I started seeing a lot of things in her that made me think that we might have a lot of things in common . Long story short I kept my feelings for myself for a whole year and then I tried to have a talk with her through a friend but it ended up in her rejecting me ( she even refused to talk to me ) the reaction fucked me up big time even though it was kind of expected but the cruel way she handled this was way beyond the worst scenario that was going through my mind . I was actually anticipating the no but not in this way... I ended up hurting myself with a piece of glass and I almost slit my wrists ... I could not focus on studying so I failed an important final exam ...next year was actually good a new start In a new school and nothing to remember the girl . I studied hard that year and I got a school price for getting the highest marks and as soon as I started forgetting about the past (A) blocked me on fb . It was the most random thing that ever happened to me because even though I kept following her on fb I never commented reacted or even liked any of her posts ( they were a lot ) . A lot of you might think that things were bad between us actually it was not bad yes we were not friends but we were classmates for 3 years and even when I was mad or fucked up I never showed her any signs that can make her feel uncomfortable ..and now after 6 years I am sick of everything I realised that she is a spoiled rich girl( she might be from the 10% in my country ) always seeking attention ( she travels like 5 times a year and even when she is not traveling she is always partying and chilling in expensive hotels ) keep in your mind that I am from a third world country so what might look normal is considered a luxury and she is obviously living the most luxurious life possible in here . I don't really bother people being rich and spoiling their kids but analysing what happened to me with her it seems like she acted shit because of a feeling of superiority . I am by no means poor and even if I was poor I would not accept getting humiliated because of her dad's money . Now I am super resentful towards her and whenever I see her I feel like my heart is stopping. This and the school stress got me sick and I developed a thyroid decease ( rare for my age and gender) . I am now depressed and I gained almost 30 pound , suicidal thoughts are taking over and the world is just a wasteland in my eyes I know I am still but I also know that I have severe mental problems ( I have a lot of personalities in my head that I talk to and sometimes they make me lose control and sometimes I get into a lot of mood swings . I don't know what is wrong with me because mental health service is not a thing in here ). TLDR : mental and personal problems making me willing to put an end to my life",suicide

After the movie we went to a park and talked and a some point we both say that we like like each other, so i get home and i'm low key freaking out cause this smart and beautiful woman likes me back. So over the period of the next few months we hang out some more (we live kinda far away so not that often) and she even kisses me on the cheek at the end of one which felt amazing. Messaging each other was kind of limited outside of organising meeting up because hella autism, but in person it was great. So skip to a couple months ago  she asks to do a call and for any normal functioning person yeah easy, but not for me, getting tons of anxiety but agree anyways because i like her a lot. Kinda awkward cause i'm dying from anxiety get through it tho, and do it a couple more times (not any easier) and on the last one she asks me why i'm so nervous because i'm not person, and i basically say using the internet to talk and message gives me hella anxiety and i don't want to mess things up with her by doing the wrong thing, I said it less direct than that but she got what i meant despite saying other wise at the time. So we ended the call and i feel good because i told her, next morning i get a message from her and i already know i gonging to be awful just from the notification because the first word she starts the message with my name like a fucking letter, and i literally collapse in my bedroom and i just start thinking of all the possible awful things it could be, and so eventually after like an hour i read it and its just as awful as i imagined, i'll summarise because i hate re reading it, *Cookie yesterday was awkward, i knew exactly what you were saying but didn't know how to respond to it, i thought we were just good friends and i'm not ready to be anything more*.

348056,"Not depressed or suicidal, just need to talk/ventHey, so I don't know if this is the right place for this, as you can probably see I'm not suicidal, or even depressed probably, I'm just really down and have been for the past few days. I feel pretty awful, I'm not sure where to start with this so that it makes sense. This may look like a post looking for advice, while advice is welcome, I'm more looking for a place to vent/sympathy :)

 I live in a small village, very small, there are about 200 people in my High School and about 20 in my class last year. Accordingly this small tight knit atmosphere can make you feel so alone, and it did for me. Until I was around 15 I was bullied, very badly in the start though it got better until it stopped when I got older. That doesn't really bother me that much though at the minute, I've gotten over it really, what bothers me more is the loneliness I feel right now. For various (academic) reasons I have taken a year out after High School instead of going to University, and went to College for a year, so right now I am barely seeing people.

Though it's not just the lack of contact that makes me feel shit, it's more a lack of female contact. Due to living in a tiny village and being socially inept until I was 16, I've never kissed a  girl, which, at the age of 18, really depresses me. On Saturday I went out with friends I didn't really know (long boring story as to why we all went out), in a city (about 3 hours away) and I met a girl. I'd met her before years ago, and we became quite close friends but kind of drifted apart. Anyway we hit it off well on Saturday. (I think anyway, pretty sure there was something there, just don't know what that 'thing' was, just drunken mutual attraction or something more, other people did say stuff as well), I'm pretty sure I like her, she's pretty, smart, nice, fun, slightly nerdy, likes awesome music, probably cooler than me and artistic, all things I love in a girl, but there are two problems. Firstly she lives about 3 hours away from me, this is also a problem as I have no excuse to see her, and it's unlikely that I'll ever see her again until at least September (The University she goes to is my second or third choice university, but my first choice haven't responded yet) and even that is pretty unlikely. And secondly she has a boyfriend. I feel pretty down about this and it doesn't help that I spend all my time on the internet.

College is only a couple hours each week and it doesn't really challenge me, I live at least a 2 hour walk from the nearest village, and I can't drive (yet). I'm looking for things to do, but I can;t seem to find anything, I've thought about exercising but find it hard to get myself motivated, plus there's not much to do apart from walk/run through forest, which never interested me. (I'm a pretty skinny guy, but by no means unattractive), apart from that I've got no idea what to do all day.

Im 16 years old, im a female, im 5'2, weigh 113 pounds and im mexican american. I have anxiety and depression from sexual, emotional and physical abuse from when i was young and because of fucking school. Ive always hated everything about myself, i wrote my first suicide note on the mirror of the 2 bedroom  apartment me and my family lived in with my moms lipstick when i was around 8. I dont remember exactly what i wrote, but it was pleading god to send me to heaven and to make my family to care enough to bury me. My mom was cooking, my dad was at work and my siblings were with my cousins. I sat in front of the mirror, starring at my reflection for what seemed like an hour but was probably 10 minutes. I was crying at how ugly and worthless i was. After those minutes, i got up and wiped the note off with a sock and left to play tag. I have always been a coward. 8 years later and im still here, but i dont know why. Today i have 3 friends, but our friendships are nothing special. They tell me everything about their lives and i listen, but the second i try to open up about something from mine, they play the ""whose got it worse"" game and start telling me of stuff theyve heard on the news.

348092,"paralyzing anxiety &amp; depression are pushing me to the edge (20F) long postHello,

I've never posted something like this before. I'll try to give a quick rundown as a backstory for anyone who may care enough to click on this post. I hope the language and story itself doesn't come across as dramatic or like I'm whining about anything. I am suffering, and truly don't know what to do.

Basically, I have two types of uncomfortably debilitating trauma (r*pe &amp; molestation) that sends me into dissociative episodes quite frequently. To cope with this, I made the healthy decision to go to counseling at my university. I worked with my counselor, a lovely man, for about a year and a half (November '16-~March '18) to try and understand the trauma better. I definitely have worked extremely hard in this aspect and while I am obviously not comfortable with it, I can cope. I also have history of EDNOS/binge disorder/elements of anorexia, essentially a horrific relationship with food and my weight, AND have a weird form of body dysmorphia where I don't trust mirrors or cameras and have no idea what my body looks like, which obviously bothers me extensively due to my history with body image issues. 

In late Feb. 2018, I experienced an extremely long depressive episode wherein I self-harmed at night to distract myself from the thoughts I was experiencing (never thought I would make it to the age of 20 because my childhood and teen years were spent with severe suicidal ideation [picked a date, harmed, etc., but never really had a plan] and I assumed I would die before then). I was essentially in what several professionals have told me was 'crisis mode' and took it upon myself to go to emergency counseling via my university again (note: at this point had never been diagnosed except by my counselor, had never been to therapy other than counseling), but MY counselor was out for the week and my assigned counselor thought I was having a manic period [note: was not consequently diagnosed with bipolar or borderline although I have suspicions] and sent me to an inpatient facility for about a week. I was put on Lexapro [major depression diagnosis], Seroquel [GAD and sleep aid, at night &amp; PRN], and Vistaril [GAD, 1x daily and PRN]. Lexapro had me manic for a full week which I've heard is a sign it's not compatible with you, but I tried to stay positive after the mood drop and continued to take it. I HATED Seroquel, it fucked with my sleep so horribly that I fully took myself off it after about 3 weeks. I felt guilty about this but at the time I was trying to readjust to going to classes after missing a full week and didn't want my sleep issues to get in the way of it. I had also received follow up instructions from the hospital I was at that essentially told me I only had a 30 day supply of the meds and needed to get a permanent supplier and therapist. 

Naturally, I did not. I tried my hardest, but every local facility never picked up my calls and returned my voicemails when I could not answer the phone. I was playing phone tag with literally fucking no one, and consequently gave up on the search. This is where I began to lose my grip on my motivation to 'get better'. I was able to receive an emergency month's supply after my first prescription ran out from my PCP, but after that month's Lexapro ran out, I convinced myself it was hindering rather than helping me and weaned myself off of it. I have not tried to contact a psychiatrist since, and this was about 1.5 months ago. 

The depressive episode continued, or maybe just blended into the one I'm in now, and post-Lexapro I was experiencing very consistent and DAILY dissociative symptoms. I would 'wake up' from walking around campus and not know how I got to where I was standing. I lost hours upon hours and consequently started to lose my grip on reality. This also didn't help my body dysmorphia and I felt like I was going insane. I had another self harming episode and stopped going to all classes. Instead I would wake up at a random hour in the afternoon, ask a few friends what they were doing, and go and smoke with them. To pinpoint when this started, it was literally right after this year's Passover/my Spring Break, so I've been like this since the beginning of April. I began making jokes about how I hadn't been sober in a month, but they really weren't jokes. I was dependent on the weed for a lot of things, including forcing myself to eat. On Lexapro I was rarely hungry and my stupid eating disordered brain loved it. Off Lexapro, the thought of food made me nauseous and I would start to gag if I tried to eat anything, UNLESS I had smoked weed prior to trying to eat. 

Currently, I take Vistaril PRN and have genuinely not had a single sober day in two months. I've lost all sense of who I am and any of my passions. I have three fucking majors in college that I LOVED. I FUCKING LOVED LEARNING AND WRITING ACADEMIC PAPERS AND DOING WHAT I LOVED. And now my depression is eating me alive and I just don't know how to escape it. I failed all my classes this semester. I gave up completely. I have absolutely no motivation to help myself after phone tag and the medication not helping. I also still cannot see a future for myself and have been getting increasingly more and more suicidal the more anxious I get over letting myself just fail a whole semester and fail myself by not taking care of myself. I don't know if you can tell, but it's one of the most vicious cycles I've been trapped in since I was restricting my calories at 11-18. 

I am home from college for the summer, and my mother knows NOTHING. She thinks I adapted well to being back in classes, or at the very least thinks I passed. She doesn't understand mental illness very well, and it's not like I want to sit her down and tell her, 'Hey, I want to kill myself because I've ruined everything for myself completely'. I also honestly don't care about myself enough to reach out for help. Typing this out right now, it's not even a cry for help. The whole point of this post is me needing coping mechanisms, I guess. I can't eat without nausea, and if I eat while high I eat too much to the point where I feel as though I'll puke. There's no calm medium in my life anymore, and my options are between two extremes. Today, I tried to eat the pasta I had as leftovers from lunch (where I had literally two noodles and gave up) and basically chewed the food until it was mush, spat it out, tried to make myself puke into the sink in front of my mother, started crying, launched into a panic attack, ran downstairs to find my Vistaril in the unpacked car (from moving out of my dorm), and sat in the car for an hour contemplating if I was going to give my life one last try or just kill myself. 

Right now, I do not know where I stand in terms of my own life. I daydream about overdosing. I've gotten to the point where I feel as though nothing would change if I were dead -- which is really bad, considering that when I had suicidal ideation as a teenager, I always told myself that so many people would be sad if I died, and I had things keeping me around; essentially excuses that I guess worked. But now I don't fucking care, I feel like I'm constantly at battle with my brain and if I make the wrong move, I have physiological reactions that I can't quell. Nothing is fun anymore. My self esteem is at an all time low after gaining 20 fucking pounds in 2 months. I want to either be dead or to be at a point in my life where I am fully medicated on something that WORKS for me, and back in school fixing what I created for myself this semester. The latter option takes so much effort, time, and care that I simply do not have. I'm basically toying with my life, lmao. I don't feel like going through month long round of different medications to see 'what works'. I don't feel like dealing with dissociation. I especially do not want to be living in the body I'm in right now. (Another telling sign that I've given up is that when I was younger, I very closely followed the stupid pro-ana mindset of ""I can't die until I'm skinny""; but now I'm overweight and if I died this way I wouldn't care.) 

My biggest flaw, as you may have picked up on, is that I am too aware for my own good. I see every path I can take from this very second forward, and some end ""well"", and some end ""badly"". I don't know where to sort ""killing myself"" and ""getting help"". My apathy is either hindering me from doing what's right (I suppose getting help) or pushing myself to die. There are so, so, so many healthy steps I could take for myself. I could protect myself and help my future. I just can't bear the idea of staying alive long enough to have one. 

I apologize for the long post. ",suicide

I have been dealing with depression myself and I have had thoughts about killing myself too for a long time. I don't know how to get better myself and look after my mum. We don't know how to guarantee her safety in the long term

348108,"The usual stuff you find hereI'm not posting this for sympathy or pity because I know there are far worse situations then mine but I just want to get this stuff out there. 

But it just seems in my life that there is no point to. Everything I have done in life I have ruined or quit, I have isolated myself from everyone even my own family. Not even like telling them (my family) would help, they'd just consider me psychotic and they are probably right for all I know.  I'm 18 and have no sense on what the fuck the universe wants from me, and thinking about it, seems like the universe fucked up when they made me ( I know that's not how I'm ""made"" just fuck off) because I don't think it knows what it wants from me, and all I get from people trying to help is how they went through ""rough patches"" and just got to tough it out. I'm done ""toughing"" it out, life shouldn't be toughing it out. I look around in my family and since I'm the youngest I've seen all the ridiculous shit that has happened to them all and it's fucked, And I post this in this area because this isn't the first time I have felt like this, I have tried to take my life before, and couldn't do it. WHAT A BITCH I KNOW, I mean seriously what cruel joke is being played on me. I despise my life and just want to know what it would be like if i ended it and I can't even do that. It's so fucked too because whenever I was around ""friends"" I would just put on this macho toughness guy like nothing hurt me and I just kept everything bottled up, and there shouldn't be anything in my life that I should complain about because I had the option to make it better but what good would come of it. I failed out of college because of this and I will probably never get back of track, so that light so-called light at the end of the tunnel is getting smaller by the day. ",suicide
